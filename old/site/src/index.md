# Humanity, Blessed: TTRPG

> Tiny bit of humanity,  
> Blessed with your mother’s face,  
> And cursed with your father’s mind.

## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, designed to tell stories, about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.
