# Endeavor Monstrosities

## What is a Monstrosity?

A Monstrosity does not have a set of Stats or Abilities in the same way any other character would. While a Monstrosity is a "character" for the sake of wording in rules, Monstrosities feel somehow different, strange, more powerful, just "off," or so on compared to non-Monstrous things. And mechanically they reflect this.

Even a non-Monstrous non-player character, once it becomes a Monstrosity for the sake of a Monstrous Endeavor, changes. This is to reflect that *thing* that makes Monstrosities narratively interesting in your setting.

So when you create Monstrosities, take time to thing about what it means to be "Monstrous" in your setting, and then use Monstrous Endeavors as a way to play with that idea over a period of sustained tension.

If your players are facing off against other non-Monstrous characters, then reflect that by using a non-Monstrous Endeavor.

Reserve Monstrous Endeavors for encounters that are truly Monstrous.

## Monstrous Stats

Instead of a number of Stat dice, a Monstrosity has a single die shared by all their Stats. And to allow a finer gradient of "weak" to "strong" Monstrosities, their Stat dice is a capped die, from $dc2$ to $dc10$.

## Stronger Monstrosities

The die cap $dc10$ is the strongest die cap a Monstrosity can have, and the player characters will, in just a few sessions, catch up to this point.

For higher level Endeavors, you may give your Monstrosities Abilities, choosing from the list below or creating your own.

Additionally, you may have your Monstrosities enter Endeavors with a number of Blessings.

## Monstrous Abilities

All Monstrosities have the Capture Ability.

**Capture:** When you gain advantage movement, you may move backward on the number line any amount. If you do, choose an opponent. That opponent then performs a Check where the target is equal to the number of spaces you moved backward. If they fail, you non-lethally remove that opponent from the Endeavor and advance toward your objectives. Then regardless of the Check's result, the current round immediately ends. At the end of subsequent rounds, that opponent may attempt this Check again to re-enter the Endeavor.

You may also give your Monstrosities any of the following Monstrous Abilities or create your own. These Abilities are listed in a rough order from "weakest" to "strongest."

It is also recommended that you do not give your Monstrosities many Abilities--one or two well-placed Abilities are plenty to make a Monstrosity memorable! Consider adding multiple Monstrosities to a Monstrous Endeavor that have complementary skills to create sessions that feel engaging and strategic. And for Monstrosities that use "magic" or wield some other kind of powerful force, we recommend using the Spark Rush $X$ Ability, flavoring it for the occasion.

**Resistance vs. $X$:** Whenever you would lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

**Revenge:** When you become Muddled, you may immediately perform a Contest as an Attacker against the character that Muddled you, as though this Contest were a Side Action, even if you or the Defender have already acted this round.

**Shield vs. $X$:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Resistance vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ② to recharge it.

**Flatten:** When you succeed a Hand Contest against an opponent during an Endeavor, you may have that opponent move backwards a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Debilitate $X$:** Perform a $X$ Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, that opponent’s $X$ rolls are made with a $-1$ modifier for that many rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ② to recharge it.

**Propel:** When determining the Focal Action, you may exchange the result of your own roll with that of an ally who rolled lower than you. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ② to recharge it.

**Clarity:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have the muddle buttons of your allies move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Immunity vs. $X$:** Whenever you would lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, you instead succeed by $1$.

**Inspire:** When you succeed a Hurry Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may choose an ally and have the roll they make to determine the Focal Action next round increase by $+3$ or by a number equal to the amount you moved forward as a result of the Check, whichever is lower. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ④ to recharge it.

**Curse:** Perform a Head Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, the opponent is Cursed by you for that many rounds. (When you see that opponent perform a roll, you may choose to have them reroll it and take the new value, then the Curse ends. Otherwise, the Curse ends when that many rounds have passed.)  Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Mirror vs. $X$:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Immunity vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ⑥ to recharge it.

**Spark Rush $X$:** Perform a Check. The amount you move forward as a result of this Check, for that many rounds, to a maximum of $3$ rounds, you may Spark using $2dcX$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend Ⓧ to recharge it.

**Empower:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies increase their die caps by $1$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it. A character can only benefit from one instance of this Ability at a time.

**Fervor:** When you succeed a Heart Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Revenge for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ⑥ to recharge it.

**Unrelenting:** At the end of each round, move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.

**Merciless:** At the end of each round, gain a number of Blessings equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.

## Spoils

Characters do not level up or gain experience points for defeating Monstrosities. Instead, like any other important moment in the narrative, you may choose to award your players Blessings for progressing through a milestone or for creative or cooperative gameplay during the Monstrous Endeavor. 

Additionally, at the end of a Monstrous Endeavor, you may permit your players to perform Checks to find items of interest along the "spoils" of their victory. For example, players may look for parts they can reuse when they defeat murderous robots, a clue revealing the location of the mad scientist's hideout when they calm and befriend one of her creations, or so on.

These narratively reflective moments after a Monstrous Endeavor can be a great chance to rebalance the narrative tension while giving your players agency in thinking about where the story goes next.

## Example Monstrosities

The following table shows a variety of example Monstrosity builds. For each, it shows their die cap, how many Blessings they enter Endeavors with, their Stamina, at what position(s) the Monstrosity's muddle buttons are placed, their Abilities (if any), and a brief comment about that build. The purpose of this table is not to provide a compendium of Monstrosities to choose from, but to provide enough examples to give you a sense of mechanically balanced Monstrosities so that you can create memorable, fun Monstrous Encounters of your own.

## Monstrosity Equations

As another starting point, the following relationships between the parts of a Monstrosity's build tend to produce balanced, mechanically familiar builds:

- Die caps range from $2$ to $10$, with die caps maxing out around the 33% mark of a campaign.
- The number of Blessings a Monstrosity starts Endeavors with range from $0$ to $20$, with "everyday" Monstrosities starting to get Blessings around the 33% mark of a campaign, and maxing out toward the end of the campaign. For Monstrosities that have a "squad leader" feel earlier in the campaign, give them $1$ or $2$ Blessings.
- Stamina is typically $5$ times the Monstrosity's die cap, but ranging from roughly $3$ to $8$ times. Stamina around the low end of this range gives a "squishier" feel to the Monstrosity, and Stamina around the high end gives a "tankier" feel. For Monstrosities with an "arc boss" feel, give them closer to $5$ times the *sum* of their die caps and number of Blessings.
- Almost all Monstrosities have only a single muddle button, placed on the number line at a point ranging form around one fifth to one half of their Stamina. Muddle button positions around the low end of this range give an "unprotected" feel, and positions around the high end give an "armored" feel. Also, pairing a low muddle button position with the Revenge ability gives a "hair trigger" feel.
- For Monstrosities with an "arc boss" feel, give them multiple evenly spaced muddle buttons, paired with Unrelenting or Merciless.

## Optional: Experience Points

If you *do* want to use an experience points (XP) system for your campaign, we recommend the following:

- A Monstrosity's XP ranges from one half to five times the sum of their die cap and number of Blessings.
    - One half: Monstrosity feels underpowered for the current tier of play
    - One times: Monstrosity feels about right for a typical foe at this tier of play
    - Two times: Monstrosity feels a little more powered than its peers, such as having a higher Muddle button or more Abilities than the typical foe at that tier of play
    - Three times: A surprising strong foe for this tier of play, a trial to be overcome but not an arc boss
    - Four times: An arc boss
    - Five times: Endgame
- Total the XP for all Monstrosities in the Endeavor to get the Endeavor's XP
- Track the Endeavor XP high score the party has achieved. This is instead of tracking the total of all XP ever gained, as is common in many combat-based RPGs
- When the party gains a new Endeavor XP high score, award them a total prize relative to the *increase* in that high score from its previous value. For example, when the party increases their high score from $3$ to $6$, you might award them $3$ Blessings divided among them

This approach allows you to represent larger spoils consistently for larger-feeling Endeavors, while not outpacing the game's linear progression system (the Session Shop).
