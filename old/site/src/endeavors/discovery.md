# Discovery Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters explore a mansion for clues, search through the rubble of a crashed spaceship, delve into a dungeon, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, or added into any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Lay of the Land:** At the top of the first round, the DM will provide the lay of the land of the environment the characters are exploring, such as what rooms are available and how they relate. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own number line and lay of the land. 
- **Glimmer Buttons:** When the DM gives a lay of the land, a number of "glimmer buttons" are added throughout the number line. When the movement of a character moves over one of these points on the number line, that character can attempt to interact with that glimmer button. If a character would activate multiple glimmer buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate.
- **Interacting with Glimmer Buttons:** To interact with a glimmer button and gain the discovery associated with it, a character must succeed a Check. The target for this Check is equal to the glimmer button's position on the number line. If the character's most recent roll in the Endeavor would have met this target, then the character automatically succeeds this Check. This Check is considered an extension to the character's current course of action and does not provide additional movement toward the Endeavor. When this Check is succeeded, the glimmer button is removed from the number line. It may also be removed when the Check is failed, at DM's discretion.
- **Types of Glimmer Buttons:** The DM may add multiple types of glimmer buttons to the number line, representing different types of discoveries for the area, such as items, information, social interactions, or further areas to explore.
- **History and Glimmer Buttons:** A character may also automatically succeed the Check to interact with a glimmer button if their History Stat die is high enough (at DM discretion) and the scope of their History Stat is relevant enough to the glimmer button in question. In such case, the DM may alternatively use a success on the glimmer button's Check to provide extra benefit or to give the character narrative control for a moment.

!!! details "DM Note: Preparing Glimmer Buttons"
    You do not need to specify ahead of time which discoveries correspond to each glimmer button. Instead, decide which categories of discoveries might be present in the area: items, information, social interactions, traps, or so on.

    Then, for each, decide how copious it might be in the area:

    - Rare: Roll $1d4-2$ and if the result is positive add that many glimmer buttons of that type to the number line. This die bumps as usual. (For even rarer discoveries, you can roll $1d4-3$ or $1d4-4$ instead.)
    - Uncommon: Do the same as above, but with $1d4$.
    - Common: Do the same as above, but with $1d6$.
    - Abundant: Do the same as above, but with $1d8$.
    - Copious: Do the same as above, but with $1d10$.

    Then, improvise following your players' choices. For example, when they decide to interact with a "loot" glimmer at position $10$ instead of a "social" glimmer, ask yourself:
    
    - What are they looking for?
    - What Stat did they use to reach it?
    - What would a "loot" of target $10$ look like?
    - What might be available in this area?
    - How does this area relate to the larger area and events of the story?
    - What information can you present alongside it?
    - What item, result, or information could be given for free based on the character's History scope?
    - If the character will need to roll a new Check to interact with the glimmer, what Stat can you ask them to roll that will add new detail to the scene without being the same Stat they just rolled?

!!! details "DM Note: Automatic Glimmer Button Success"
    While it is up to your discretion, here is a good rule of thumb for how large a character's History Stat die needs to be to automatically succeed a glimmer button's Check: double the largest number on the character's History Stat die then subtract $2$. Any glimmer button whose target is at most that number and also related to the character's History Stat scope could reasonably be automatically succeeded.

    For example, a $d6$ History Stat die could automatically succeed targets $10$ or less for related glimmer buttons.

    Moreover, you can use this rule of thumb to provide information when a character fails a glimmer button's Check: What would a character's History Stat die and scope need to be to automatically succeed, and who in the narrative meets those requirements that the character could turn to for help? This moves the story forward by creating a new "side quest" and expanding the world, without giving away the glimmer button's information right away.
