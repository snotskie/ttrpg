# Monstrous Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Muddle Buttons:** When each Monstrosity joins the Endeavor, it adds one or more "muddle buttons" to the number line. When the movement of a player character or one of their allies moves over one of these points on the number line, that Monstrosity is Muddled (see [Example Conditions](#Example-Conditions)) for the next round, representing a momentary crack in the Monstrosity's defenses--literally or figuratively. Then, the button is removed. If a player character or one of their allies would activate multiple muddle buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate. Be warned though, as some Monstrosities have Abilities that grow in power the more times they've been muddled this way!
- **Stamina:** Each Monstrosity has an amount of "stamina." At the end of each round, if the player characters and their allies have a combined value on the number line equal to or greater than a Monstrosity's stamina, those characters may move backwards on the number line a total amount equal to the Monstrosity's stamina. If they do, they non-lethally remove that Monstrosity from the Endeavor and narrate what happens.
