### About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

## Making Your First Character
<!-- _class: center major creation -->

### Character Creation | Step One!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe the **Stats** used in *Humanity, Blessed*, known collectively as **the H's of Humanity**. Your GM may add an additional one as well.

Your first task is to decide **which Stat your character is best at**.

As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. **Why are they good at this and not at that?** Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

When you begin the game, most of your Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Checks. However, the Stat you chose as your **highest Stat begins the game one die size larger**. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Stat Dice.

All of your Stat Dice may be **upgraded later in the Session Shop** section at the end of this chapter.

### Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

All characters in this game have the following Stats, each related to a different "scope" of action:

| üß† Head Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music, picking locks. *High/Low:* With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. But with a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach. |

| ‚úåÔ∏è Hand Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Athletic pursuits, endurance, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly, pickpocketing. *High/Low:* With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. But with a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üíï Heart Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally, creating expressive art, performing sleights of hand for an audience. *High/Low:* With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. But with a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are. |

| ‚òï Home Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Protecting yourself and loved ones, tending to illness and wounds, shopping, crafting, scavenging, camping, cooking, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. *High/Low:* With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. But with a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you seem to always misplace things. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëø Hurt Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. *High/Low:* With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. But with a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies. |

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. *High/Low:* With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. But with a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like. |

| ‚è≥ History Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, and hardships covered by your Focus, as well as other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people but not covered by your other Stats. *High/Low:* With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialized training you set out to achieve. But with a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often. |

### Optional Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

Your GM may add one of the following Stats to your game, depending on the game's setting and tone:

| ü™∂ Hex Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *Setting:* Magic or fantasy. |

| ü•ï Ham Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *Setting:* Cartoon. |

| üîé Hunch Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *Setting:* Film noir. |

| ü¶æ Hardware Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *Setting:* Cyberpunk. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëæ Hologram Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. *Setting:* Futuristic. |

| üí∞ Hireling Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *Setting:* Absurd capitalist. |

| üéÅ Holly Jolly Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *Setting:* Winter wonderland. |

| üéß Headline Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *Setting:* Battle of the bands. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| ü¶† Host Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. *Effect:* When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while using this Stat, receive $+d2$ in aid. There may be consequences. *Setting:* Alien paranormal suspense. |

| üíÄ Hardship Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. *Effect:* This Stat cannot be only be a $d4$. *Setting:* Suspense horror. |

| üëª Haunted Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. *Effect:* This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, and can only be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d2$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. *Setting:* Poe style. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üå≥ Hardy Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements emerging from each session's obstacles and players' combined efforts against the challenges they've faced. *Effect:* This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d2$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy Stat Die instead of one of their other Stat Dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d2$. *Setting:* Coming of age. |

| ‚ö´ Haze Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. *Effect:* This die begins the game as a $d2$ and only changes when the character fails certain Checks or loses certain Contests against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat Die instead of their own usual die for the roll. *Setting:* Psychological horror. |

### Stat Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each of a character's Stats is represented by a Stat Die.

In general:

- **Die Sizes:** A Stat Die can be one of five sizes, ranging from $d2$ to $d10$, as described in the Stat Dice Notation table below.
- **Stat Dice "Bump":** Stat Dice in this game "bump." This means that when you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again and add the new result to the previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.
- **Skill and Determination:** Success and victory without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination or focus on the action.

#### Stat Dice Notation

| Notation | Stat Die |
| -------- | -------- |
| $d10$ | A ten-sided die. The largest die size in the game. |
| $d8$  | An eight-sided die. |
| $d6$  | A six-sided die. |
| $d4$  | A four-sided die. |
| $d2$  | Any of the above dice, treating any odd number as $1$ and any even number as $2$. The smallest die size in the game. |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Bumping Dice Groups:** Some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.
- **Explicit Dice Grouping Only:** Note, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Character Creation | Step Two!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe **Lifestyle** and **Ethic** options. Some Lifestyles are **upgrade options** you will not have access to when the game begins.

As you read them, begin to describe the life your character had **growing up** and their **current outlook** on the world. You may also want to consult the **Playing the Game chapter** to learn more about the rules Lifestyles interact with.

Then, pick one of the **Lifestyles** with the `Starter` label and one of the **Ethics** to begin the game with. These can be changed later in the Session Shop.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

Once you've chosen your starter Lifestyle and Ethic, consult the table below. **Two of your Stats** begin the game an additional **die size larger**, according to your starter Lifestyle and Ethic:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <th scope="col">Vice &amp; Virtue</th>
        <th scope="col">Fate &amp; Knowledge</th>
        <th scope="col">Cunning &amp; Capability</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Carefree</th> <td>Heart and Hurry</td> <td>Head and Hurt</td> <td>Hand and Home</td> </tr>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Eager</th> <td>Hand and Hurt</td> <td>Heart and Home</td> <td>Head and Hurry</td> </tr>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Wisened</th> <td>Head and Home</td> <td>Hand and Hurry</td> <td>Heart and Hurt</td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

| *Description:* At the end of the day, you may believe that the only person you can really trust is yourself. You may also believe that the world is unfair, "good" and "fate" are made up ideas, and you'd do whatever it takes to just get by. |

### GM Guide | Campaign Ethic
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you begin to imagine the world and genre of your campaign, consider what it means to be "Carefree," "Eager," or "Wisened" in your setting. Doing so requires making assumptions about the Ethic of the world itself!

**‚öîÔ∏è Vice &amp; Virtue** settings are well equipped for high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories. This is likely the most familiar genre for your players, especially for good vs. evil stories. The Blossomed, Driven, and Steadfast upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge** settings are well equipped for dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror. This genre resists feeling familiar, as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. The Prodigious, Chosen, and Warry upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability** settings are well equipped for cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories. This genre is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without necessarily a clear good vs. evil component. The Crafty, Wired, and Compelling upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

### Character Creation | Step Three!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe your character's backstory. **Answer the following prompts** or others given to you by your GM.

These background details will help you and your GM build the story and set the **Focus** of your **History Stat**.

- Describe **who your character looks up to**, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
- List **three specific skills** that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
- List **three specific people or groups** that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
- Describe **where your character could be found** on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
- If your game's setting has **non-human characters** and your character is one of them, work with your GM to determine how your non-human background affects your Focus or the scope of your Stats.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

And as you play, **keep notes**! These can help you reflect on you and your group's shared "Group History," as well as your **character's relationship to the Group History**. Maybe not everyone in the party is enthused about the items the party stole last time!

Such reflection can help you **shape the course** of your Focus and your character's development over the duration of the story, **make important character choices** during your sessions, and **inspire you and your GM** for ideas for future scenes and sessions.

### GM Guide | Determining Focus
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you work with your players to develop their backstory and Focus, come up with a list of three to five specific narrative elements for each player that describe what their History Stat covers. For example:

- Tying Knots (for a scout)
- Swordfighting (for a knight)
- Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn)
- Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician)
- Acting (for a theater kid)
- Manipulating Technology (for a hacker)
- Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer)
- Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the empire)
- Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the empire)

Consider what *unique* skills, proficiencies, traits, and backstory elements each character brings to the story. Also consider the *variety* of a character's Focus: if all or most of them would be covered already by another Stat, then the player would have no reason to use or upgrade their History Stat!

### GM Guide | Non-Human Characters
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your game's setting allows your players to create non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent it. The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds between your players:

- **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's Focus to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their non-human background could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.
- **Low Variety:** If player characters all come from just a few non-human background options, then using their Focus to cover this background would clog them with details that aren't unique to each player. Instead, expand the scope of two or three Stats besides History to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.

### Character Creation | Step Four!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe another type of dice in this game, **Blessing Dice**, as well as several **Ability** options. As your read, you may want to consult the **Playing the Game** chapter to learn more about the rules Abilities interact with.

To help you select your starter Abilities, begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. **Have you seen characters like them before** in movies, TV shows, and books? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

Then with that in mind, **pick two** of the following Abilities with the `Starter` label to begin the game with. You may gain additional Abilities later in the Session Shop.

### Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Abilities and other effects cost "Blessing Dice" to activate.

In general:

- **Pool of Blessing Dice:** Each character has a pool of Blessing Dice, representing resources they can draw upon when the moment calls.
- **Gaining Blessing Dice:** The GM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements. When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice.
- **Spending Blessing Dice:** When you spend a Blessing Die, remove it from your pool of Blessing Dice. An effect may require you to spend a Blessing Die of at least a certain size. An effect may also require you to spend multiple Blessing Dice at the same time. The Blessing Dice Notation table below provides a few examples of how Blessing Dice costs are notated.
- **Blessing Dice Bump:** Like your Stat Dice, Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way. When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.
- **Gain One at a Time:** If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Blessing Dice Notation

| Notation | Blessing Dice |
| -------- | ------------- |
| ‚ë• | A Blessing Die worth $6$. The largest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë° | A Blessing Die worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë† | A Blessing Die worth $1$ or more. The smallest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë°‚ë° | Two Blessing Dice each worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | Two Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚ë† $\times 4$ | Four Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚äú‚äú | Two Blessing Dice of the same worth. |

### GM Guide | When to Award Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: guide -->

You should award players Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters' abilities depend on them.

What this looks like can vary per GM, per table, or per scene.

Some GMs may prefer an approach where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer an approach where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a GM in this game! Use it well!

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

All this being said, we recommend new GMs to this game use the following:

- Award $3$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such as after the player has introduced their character.
- Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions.
- Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story.
- Award a Blessing Die the first time each session the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $6$ or more, and award each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high win or success a Blessing Dice as well.
- Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session, before modifications to the roll from effects or Abilities. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both dice this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is almost impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game; such sessions take place narratively on an "unlucky day."

### Abilities
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters in this game may have a number of Abilities that provide them with new effects, bonuses, actions or so on.

The following pages list Ability options. These Abilities refer to a number of rules described in the next chapter. However, for now you should know:

- **Require:** Some Abilities require another Ability or condition. Such Abilities cannot be gained until you've first gained the required Ability or met the required condition.
- **Extend:** Some Abilities extend another Ability. When an Ability is extended, it no longer counts against your total number of Abilities.
- **Recharge:** Some Abilities list a recharge cost. Once activated, these Abilities cannot be activated again until they have been recharged by paying that cost.

### GM Guide | Charitable Resolve's Boon
<!-- _class: guide -->

How you rule the boon given by the "Charitable Resolve" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

However, some ideas are:

- Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
- Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
- Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

| And you think it's never a bad idea to back up and analyze the situation before charging forward. *Effect:* Twice per session, you may provide Help by rolling four $d6$ and group those dice into two piles of two.

This Ability may not be used at the start of an Endeavor round. |

### Character Creation | Step Five!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Finally, **describe your character's appearance** and list **three or four items** your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you begin the game with.

You'll track a list of items that you typically carry with you, and other items you may have can be **determined in the moment**: Over the course of the story, you may perform Checks to **find** new items, **create** new items, **purchase and sell** items, and even see if you **already have** items that could be narratively reasonable for you to have.

And while most items are narrative, some **higher quality items** you acquire along the way may provide aid or effects similar to some Abilities.

### Session Shop Upgrades
<!-- _class: ability -->

At the end of each session, you receive one free upgrade for your character. Upgrade options are listed below. Some upgrades you receive immediately, and some you receive at the end of the following session.

## Playing the Game
<!-- _class: center major rules -->

### Spark Rolls
<!-- _class: rules -->

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced" and can be "Sparked" together, representing hints of magic, ability to achieve amazing feats, surprising wins, and so on. Sparks are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination&mdash;and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

In general, Spark rolls work by grouping Stat Dice and rolling them, increasing the odds of bumping. To perform a Spark roll:

1. **Spark a roll:** When rolling a Stat Die, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to perform a Spark roll instead, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each.
2. **Apply Usual Bonuses:** Any bonuses or effects that would apply to either of the balanced Stats used in the Spark roll also apply to the Spark roll itself.

Also note:

- **Advantageous Sparking:** You may decide to turn a roll into a Spark roll before or after you've made your first roll for the action. For example, when you roll your first $1$ on the die, you may decide to take extra advantage of this opportunity. If you do, pay the Blessing Die cost to Spark, roll your second die, then reroll both dice for the bump, and add it all together.

### Checks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Most situations in this game can be resolved by perform a Check or a Contest (described later in this chapter).

To perform a Check:

1. **Roll:** Roll the die for the action's associated Stat. The GM will let you know which to use.
2. **Outcome:** If the result of the roll meets or beats the GM's target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. Check targets by level of difficulty are given in the Check Targets table below.

Also note:

- **History Checks:** Your History Stat is used to perform actions more related to your backstory than your other Stats. When both your History Stat and another Stat would be applicable in a situation, the GM may decide which applies more. Otherwise, you choose which to use.
- **Medium Difficulty:** A "Medium difficult" target is considered the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into.
- **Adjusted Difficulty:** For situations where the GM surprises the players and they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, it is recommended the GM lower the difficulty by $1$ to $3$ because such Checks are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Check Targets

| Difficulty | Target |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Easy | $4$ |
| Medium | $8$ |
| Hard | $12$ |
| Severe | $16$ |
| Trial | $20$ |

### GM Guide | Setting Targets for Magic
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your setting has "magic" or other supernatural, reality-bending player capabilities, the way you set targets for these Checks depends on the nature of "magic" in your setting. 

We recommend providing your players a table that describes your "magic" targets for them:

- Each row of the table corresponds to a Check target, from Easy to Severe.
- Each column corresponds to a "school of magic" or category of supernatural effect.
- Each cell describes examples of what a supernatural action of that Check target and category might look like.
- Players and you determine which cells are most like what the player wants to achieve with their effect, and the highest Check target among those cells is the Check target their roll will need to meet, with you having final say on the exact Check target.
- Increase the Check target they need to hit if they are pushing the area, duration, or nature of the effect further than normal; if they are untrained in the effect or it is outside their "school of magic"; or if the effect requires forbidden knowledge.
- Performing supernatural effects requiring beyond a Severe Check target requires a "quest" to do so.

### Automatic History Check Success
<!-- _class: rules -->

At GM discretion, you may automatically succeed History Checks if your Focus is related enough to the Check and your History Stat Die is high enough.

To perform an automatic History Check success:

1. **History Stat Die Size:** To succeed a Check automatically with your History Stat Die, first the die needs to be large enough for the Check, according to the Max Automatic Checks table below.
2. **Relatedness:** Next, with with your GM to determine if your Focus is related enough to the Check.
3. **Automatic Roll:** Finally, if you are able to automatically succeed this way, you may succeed as though you had rolled exactly the Check's target. This roll cannot be modified by other effects.

Also note:

- **Low Risk Low Reward:** When you automatically succeed a Check, the "reward" for the Check may be reduced from if you had succeeded normally.
- **No Automatic Success during Endeavors:** You may not choose to automatically succeed Checks this way during Endeavors (described later in this chapter).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Max Automatic Checks

| History Stat Die | Max Check target |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| $d2$  | *Unavailable* |
| $d4$  | $4$  |
| $d6$  | $8$ |
| $d8$  | $12$ |
| $d10$ | $16$ |

### Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Contests are similar to Checks, but performed against another character. There are two types of Contests: non-violent and violent.

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character's will using any Stat besides Hurt.

To perform a non-violent Contest:

1. **Attack:** The Attacker rolls the appropriate Stat.
2. **Defense:** The Defender rolls the same Stat as the Attacker. If the Attacker uses a Spark roll, then the Defender may roll a Spark roll using either or both of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark roll, so long as the Defender pays the Blessing Die cost.
3. **Outcome:** The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The size of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores according to the Outcome Sizes and Contest Effects tables below.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Outcome Sizes

| Outcome size | Roll this much more than your opponent |
| --- | --- |
| Very Minor | $0-1$ |
| Minor | $2-3$ |
| Medium | $4-5$ |
| Major | $6-7$ |
| Very Major | $8-9$ |
| Maximum | $10+$ |

#### Contest Effects

| Outcome size | Contest effect |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Very Minor or Minor | Attacker gets what they want, with complications, and the advantage is momentary. |
| Medium | Attacker gets what they want, without complications, and the advantage lasts several rolls or shifts the narrative of the scene. |
| Major or Very Major | Attacker gets what they want, shifting the narrative arc of the session or several sessions. The ramifications of negative effects may be serious though not life-threathening. |
| Maximum | Attacker has likely gone too far for what they intended. Negative effects are serious, possibly needing immediate attention or miracle, shifting the narrative arc of several sessions or the campaign. |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character's will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially dangerous. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest:

1. **Attack:** The Attacker first rolls their Hurt Stat or a Spark roll that involves Hurt.
2. **Defense:** The Defender rolls their Hurry Stat or Spark roll that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene.
3. **Outcome:** The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The extent of the injury is determined by the difference between their scores, regardless if that was what the Attacker intended, according to the Outcome Sizes and Contest Effects tables above.
4. **Additional Attacks:** If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor.
5. **Additional Defenses:** Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these continued Attacks with a greater range of options than just Hurry, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Checks vs. Contests:** Checks use the terms "fail," "succeed," and "target," while Contests use "lose," "win," "Attack," "Defend," and "outcome size" instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. For example, the "Fortune's Bounty" Ability allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Group Checks and Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group. There are two general approaches:

- **Provide Help:** One way is to provide Help (described later in this section) to one roll that leads the group's action. Some members of the group may decide not to roll and instead wait for the group leader to roll, then provide Help to the leader by spending Blessings to increase the result of the roll.
- **Median Roll:** Another way is for each character to roll for the action, using the median of their rolls as the group's shared result. If the group roll had an even number of individual rolls, then the higher of the two median rolls is used. The Group Median Rolls table below provides a quick reference.

#### Group Median Rolls

| Rolls made | Roll used |
| ---------- | --------- |
| $2$ | Highest |
| $3$ | Second highest |
| $4$ | Second highest |
| $5$ | Third highest |
| $6$ | Third highest |
| $7$ | Fourth highest |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Mixing Group Strategies:** These two approaches may be combined, with some members rolling and taking their median, and the other members providing Help on top of that median. However, a group member cannot both roll and Help for the same action.
- **Staying Grouped:** In general, once characters become a group as part of a Check or Contest, they remain a group until the end of the Check or Contest and are treated as a single character for the sake of the rules, sharing benefits and risks.
- **Opponent Groups:** Also note, a character cannot force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

### Helping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters may spend their Blessing Dice to Help one another complete Checks and Contests. And your Abilities, events, and items in the story may also Help you in similar ways.

To provide Help:

1. **Pay Help Cost:** Once per roll, whether your own or another character's, you may Help by spending a number of Blessing Dice.
2. **Provide Help:** Then, the character you Helped rolls a die and adds the result to their roll. The more Blessing Dice spent above, the larger the die rolled, according to the Helping Costs table below.

#### Helping Costs

| Blessing Dice Spent | Bonus Added |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| ‚ë† | $+1$ |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | $+d2$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 4$ | $+d4$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 6$ | $+d6$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 8$ | $+d8$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 10$ | $+d10$ |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **No Bumping for Help:** The dice used for Help effects do not bump.
- **Help Reasonably:** ou may only Help other characters if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action and your character is not currently engaged in another action.

### Receiving Situational Aid
<!-- _class: rules -->

While you and your allies may spend Blessings to Help one another, in certain situations your Abilities, items, environment, careful planning, or so on can provide you additional Help as well&mdash;and for free!

- **Receive Aid:** Situational aid effects describe a possible failed Check or lost Contest and say to "receive $+X$ in aid" in response. When you do, you gain a $+X$ bonus to the roll, as though you were Helped by the situation, possibly turning the failure into a success or loss into a win.

Also note:

- **One Aid at a Time:** You may only receive situational aid once per roll. If multiple effects would provide situational aid during the same roll, you choose which one to use.

### Overcharged Stats
<!-- _class: rules -->

Lifestyle upgrade options overcharge one or two of a character's Stats, which provides situational aid.

- **Overcharged:** When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while performing a Spark roll using an overcharged Stat, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ is the same sized die used in the Spark roll.

### Complex Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes a character's Attack is itself a complex action normally requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

1. **Complex Attack Threshold:** In complex Attacks, the GM may set a threshold the Attacker needs to clear. The Attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the GM's threshold. This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to clear the threshold.
2. **Adjusted Outcome Size:** If both characters roll lower than the threshold, the outcome is determined as though the Defender had rolled that threshold instead.

### Delayed Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes Attacks are made that are Defended against at a later time, such as setting traps or sending letters.

Such delayed Attacks are performed as Contests as usual with the following adjustments:

- **Delay:** The Attacker performs their roll, decribes what condition would activate the Attack, and writes these both down.
- **Activate:** The Defender rolls against the Attacker's roll whenever the Attack would be activated.

Also note:

- **Limited Attacker Aid:** The Attacker cannot activate "receive aid" effects if they are not present when the Attack is activated. The Defender can still activate "receive aid" effects as usual.

### Long Actions
<!-- _class: rules -->

A long action is any action that is multi-step, spans a longer period of time than most other actions, and involves the scope of multiple Stats. For example, formulating a plan for a heist, engaging in political intrigue, piloting a crewed vessel, or running a business.

There are two approaches the GM may take to resolve long actions:

- **Simple Long Action:** The GM may ask for a single Check or Contest, using only the single Stat that the long action's success or victory most turns on. The bar for success or victory without difficulties or complications may be higher than usual in this case.
- **Thorough Long Action:** The GM may ask for multiple Checks or Contests using the various Stats involved in the long action. For overall success or victory, at least half of these rolls will need to win or succeed. However, each failure or loss may incur difficulties or complications on top of that success.

### Scrambling Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Contests are fast and chaotic, with both sides rapidly changing their plans and the Stats that would be involved&mdash;yet without amounting to the level of tension covered by Eneavors described later in this chapter. For example, quick bouts, fisticuffs, cartoonish outbreaks of "violence," and short and dramatic card games.

To perform a scrambling Contest:

1. **Half-Baked Attacks:** Quickly choose a Stat to roll, as though you were Attacking. The narrative for your Attacks do not have to be fully formed&mdash;just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats may be chosen for this Contest.
2. **Scramble:** If you rolled highest, you choose how to "scramble" the Contest. Choose which Stats everyone uses for the next roll, and you may choose different Stats for different characters. You just can't choose a Stat for a character that the character has already rolled this Contest. 
3. **Repeat:** Repeat the above step until a character has no Stats left to roll.
4. **Final Round:** If you rolled the highest during the final round of rolls, you win the overall Contest. But if you rolled very low on any of your rolls in previous rounds, then your victory may have complications.
5. **Outcome Size:** Narrate and determine the final outcome of the Contest. The outcome is determined using your final roll as an Attack and everyone else's rolls as a group Defense.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Scrambling Sparks:** If a character Sparks a roll during a scrambling Contest, the Spark roll must involve the Stat chosen for the character to use, it may not involve a Stat the character has already rolled for that Contest, and for the sake of the scrambling Contest it uses up both Stats involved.

### Coming Prepared
<!-- _class: rules -->

You may perform a Home Check to see if you already came prepared with just the item you need.

The target needed for such Checks is up to GM discretion. However, in general:

- **Suspension of Disbelief:** The target you will need to reach may depend on details such as how common, niche, specialized, rare, or unique in the world the desired item is; how probable it would be to already have that item; and how many items your character already has listed. These sorts of details greatly affect the suspension of disbelief that your character really could have the item in question.
- **Risk of Failure:** When you fail a Check to see if you already came prepared with an item, you may be unable to perform these Checks again until the end of the scene or session. And if you fail by a large amount, you may drop or break other items in your possession while digging around in your bag, alert others to your location, or so on.

### Shopping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Performing Home Checks to shop, trade, or so on is similar to performing Home Checks to see if you already came prepared with an item.

In general for shopping:

- **Stocked Shops Provide Aid:** If you are shopping in a place where it would be reasonable to find the desired item, and if would be reasonable for you to have the money or goods to trade for that item, then you may receive situational aid on the Check.
- **Risk of Failure:** Like coming prepared, if you fail a Check to shop, you may be unable to do so again until the end of the scene or session, you may lose one of your other items in a bad deal, you may anger shopkeepers or be accused of shoplifting, or so on.

### Crafting
<!-- _class: rules -->

Crafting new items from your surroundings, tools, and supplies is a long action. This is because crafting usually requires a number of tasks that span the scope of multiple Stats:

For example:

- **Home:** Gathering high quality supplies.
- **Head:** Gaining knowledge of how to construct the desired object.
- **Hand or Home:** Gathering or constructing the necessary tools.
- **Hand:** Constructing the desired object, which can involve multiple steps depending on the complexity.
- **Heart:** Improvising adjustments when tools or supplies break or when one's initial plans were imperfect.
- **Hex, Ham, Hologram, or so on:** Meddling with the forces of the universe (for settings that have a Stat for the "magic" of the world).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

In general:

- **Quality:** The target you will need to hit for this craft long action will depend on the intended "quality" or effect of your desired item, as described in the Crafted Item Quality table below. Items that would require Trial-level difficulty usually require substantial roleplay, effort, or "quests" beyond performing Checks.
- **Flaws:** Crafted items may come with flaws, even if you succeed overall. How flaws are introduced depends on how the GM chooses to resolve the craft long action.
- **Simple Flaws:** The GM may provide two targets for you to hit. To succeed you will need to hit the lower target, but to succeed without flaws or limitations you will need to hit the higher target.
- **Thorough Flaws:** The GM may require you to make multiple Checks. To succeed at crafting you will need to succeed on at least half of the individual Checks, with each failed Check introducing the chance for a flaw or limitation.

#### Crafted Item Quality

| Item quality | Typical difficulty | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Mundane | Easy or Medium | Narrative function only |
| High-Quality Mundane | Medium or Hard | Provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect |
| Powered | Severe | Provides a "receive $+d2$ in aid" effect |

### Setting Out
<!-- _class: rules -->

You and your fellow players may propose plans that could direct how you set out on a series of scenes, sessions, or whole campaign. When you do, the GM may ask for a set of rolls similar to a group long action.

- **Making Plans:** Each roll in this group long action will correspond to a different necessary step of your group's plans.
- **Gather Information:** Then, based on the results, the GM may provide different amounts or types of information to set you off on your "quest," representing your group's capabilities at planning and preparation.

### Conditions
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on, beyond mere injury. When these happen, you may become Disarmed, Surprised, Uncool, or any of the other Conditions described in the Condition Effects table below.

In general however:

- **Conditions Tell Stories:** At minimum, Conditions provide effects. However, they also represent small story arcs where you face obstacles and, in spite of the Condition's effects, overcome those obstacles. When you fail a Check or lose a Contest and gain a Condition as a result, consider how your character feels about the situation and what the Condition means to them beyond mere effect.
- **Conditions Build Connections:** Gaining and removing Conditions, and facing and overcoming obstacles, happen with other characters around. Consider, and take notes for the development of your character: Who else is around that saw the failed Check happen? How would your Hero feel about the lost Contest? And how could your connections to other characters help you remove the Condition later?

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Condition Effects

| Condition | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Ache | *Effect:* Rolls you make with the affected Stat cannot bump. *Duration:* Until next scene. |
| Cursed | *Effect:* Your Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $0$. *Duration:* Until treated. |
| Disarmed | *Effect:* When you win with a violent Attack, reduce the outcome size one rank. *Duration:* Until treated. |
| Famous | *Effect:* You may exert your fame over those less famous, gaining a $+d2$ bonus in Contests against them, but not against the same character more than once during the same session or while you are Uncool. *Duration:* Until removed. |
| Taxed | *Effect:* You cannot Spark. *Duration:* Until treated. |
| Surprised | *Effect:* Your rolls cannot bump, Spark, or be an automatic success. *Duration:* Until next roll. |
| Uncool | *Effect:* Your rolls are made with a $-1$ modifier unless you are alone. *Duration:* Until removed. |
| Vulnerable | *Effect:* When another character sees you roll the affected Stat, they may have you perform the roll again and use the new value. *Duration:* Until treated. |

### General Endeavor Rules
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes, the player characters will need to race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on! Many such scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

There are several different types of Endeavors depending on the scenario. However, all Endeavors build on these same general rules:

- **Rounds:** Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents.
- **Roll:** At the start of each round, choose a Stat to roll. The narrative for your rolls do not have to be fully formed, just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Current Roll:** Once you roll, you'll use this same Stat and roll value for all Checks and Contests for the rest of the round&mdash;or until an effect makes you reroll! So, it is important to keep track of your current roll and Stat in use.
- **Turn Order:** After rolls are made for the round, if you rolled the lowest you go first. Then whoever hasn't acted yet and holds the lowest current roll goes next, with the GM resolving ties, until all characters have gone.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->


- **Shifting Turn Order:** If an effect has you roll a new value before your turn, your turn order may change: if you roll higher you may act later, and if you roll lower you may act sooner.
- **Helping Yourself:** During your turn you may spend Blessing Dice as usual to increase the value of your own roll, so long as you have not already do so that round.
- **Actions:** Each round during your turn, you may only take one action, chosen from the set of actions available for that Endeavors. Some actions use your current roll, and some ignore it. The GM may limit the actions you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Movement:** Endeavors use a number line to track character positions, scores, progress towards goals, or so on. This number line begins at $0$ and goes up as high as needed. The Endeavor's setup instructions will describe where characters begin on the number line, and its actions will describe when and how you move.
- **Group Movement:** If a group moves together an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.
- **Special Actions:** Some actions have the `Special Action` label. Special actions cannot be used during the round. Instead, at the end of the round after all normal actions are complete, whoever has the highest current roll chooses a special action to perform, with the GM resolving ties. Then the next round begins and new rolls are made.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->
- **Buttons:** Endeavors add a number of buttons to the number line. There are two types of buttons, personal and global. Personal buttons can only be activated by the character who added them, whereas global buttons can be activated by any character. If an Endeavor uses buttons, it will describe how each is activated and the effect that happens as a result.

Also note:

- **Streamlined Success:** To streamline Endeavors, the GM allow all Checks to automatically succeed, providing larger effects for higher rolls.
- **Receiving Aid:** If the GM does streamline Checks this way, then "recieve aid" effects would be unable to activate. At GM discretion, such effects may never activate, always activate, or only activate once per Endeavor per effect.
- **Multiple Number Lines:** If an Endeavor spans a larger playing field than normal, the GM may divide the Endeavor into two or three number lines, where who you can interact with is limited based on which number line you are on. Depending on the situation, you may be able to change number lines by succeeding Checks or paying movement costs. In any case, the Endeavor still only has one special action per round across all number lines.

### GM Guide | Large-Scale Endeavors
<!-- _class: guide -->

Resolving actions that occur on massive scales&mdash;such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster&mdash;requires shifting the scale of the narrative.

This may be done in an Endeavor by spending one round at the large-scale action before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them for the next several rounds.

The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

### üõ°Ô∏è Clash Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters summoning, rallying, or inspiring allies to face off against an opposing side's summoned, rallied, or inspired allies&mdash;such as soldiers in your command, athletes you are coaching, creature companions you have befriended, knights dueling as your champions, spirits you are channeling, or spectral monsters you've summoned by playing music so well!

- **Setup:** You, your allies, and your opponents do not have a position. Instead, both sides begin the Endeavor with two "summons" on their side at position $1$. A "summon" is a character or other entity you have summoned to your side for the Endeavor, and a "summoner" is any character or group summoning others to their side. Generally a summon is considered to have existed before they were summoned to your side&mdash;"being summoned" just places them into the game's evolving story.
- **Goal:** You win when your summons have captured enough opposing summons.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Actions:** There are a number of actions that summons and summoners may choose from during the Endeavor, described in the Summon Actions and Summoner Actions tables below. At GM discretion, some summons' Abilities may grant them additional actions.

### GM Guide | Monstrous Stats
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **Stats:** A Monstrosity's has only two Stat Dice, a higher dice (HD) shared between all their strongest Stats and a lower die (LD) shared between all the rest.
- **Defenses:** A Monstrosity also has a starting position (SP) and one or two recovery buttons (RB). For compactness, if a Monstrosity is said to have an RB of $5$, then it enters with a recovery button at $5$ below its starting position. Together, these represent a Monstrosity's defenses, similar to the concept of "hit points" and "shields" used in other games.
- **Offenses:** A Monstrosity has a Capture Roll (CR) value. When a Monstrosity uses Perform a Capture, instead of rolling for the Attack, it automatically rolls its CR value. This provides a more consistent difficulty level. A Monstrosity may also have one or two Abilities that provide additional offensive actions.
- **Resources:** Finally, a Monstrosity may enter the Endeavor with a number of Blessing Dice (B). These are only used by a Monstrosity to provide Help or Spark a roll.
- **Experience:** XP

<!-- _class: guide -->

The following tables provide a starting point for creating Monstrosities at different tiers of difficulty:

### üèá Race Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters race against one another or their opponents, whether it be on foot, on horseback, in sleds, in cars, or even in spaceships!

- **Setup:** All characters begin at position $1$. At the top of the first round, the GM will provide the lay of the land for the race course environment, including any terrain elements like hills, brush, holes, asteroid fields, or so on that would slow the racers down. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own number line and lay of the land.
- **Goal:** To win, be the first to reach the finish line.
- **Actions:** There are two normal actions and one special action characters may choose from during the Endeavor, described in the Race Actions table below.
- **Buttons:** When the GM gives a lay of the land, a number of terrain buttons of will be added, described in the Race Buttons table below. The GM may add multiple types of terrain buttons to the number line, representing different types of obstacles for the area, such as hills, stampedes, quantum puzzles, or trolley problem moral dilemmas. When a character begins the round on a terrain button, the type of the terrain button may constrain what Stats they may roll or what actions they may take.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Endurance Checks:** At the end of each round, if a character spent Blessings that round, they must roll a new value and succeed a Check to remain in the race, representing the character's endurance to keep racing after a hard push. The target for this Check is equal to the total number of Blessings the character has spent this Endeavor.

#### Race Actions

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;a Check | Use your current roll to perform a Check to advance your team's objectives. Move up equal to your current roll. |

Some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Alarm Buttons:** At the start of the Endeavor, the GM adds a number of "alarm buttons" throughout the number line. If a character ends its first movement of the round on the same space as an alarm button, then the character is "made" by the watchful eye they are trying to avoid. What happens when a character is made this way depends on the Encounter. For example, the party immediately loses when any character is made. Or after a number of times being made, the Endeavor changes. Or when a character is made, they perform a Check whose target is equal to the button's position on the number line, and the character is removed from the Endeavor if they fail that Check. Or so on.

- **Alarm Buttons Move:** At the end of each round, the alarm buttons move, according to some set pattern only the GM knows. Nothing happens immediately when an alarm button ends its movement in the same space as a character. However, if a character chooses to sit out from directing the Focal Action while sharing a space with an alarm button, then the chatacter is made just as though they had moved onto it.
- **Failed Checks Increase Alertness:** When a character fails a Check or loses a Contest while resolving a Focal Action or Side Action, the "alertness" of the Endeavor increases, represented by an additional alarm button being added to the number line.
- **Negative Help:** When a character receives Help, they may choose to subtract the bonus from their roll instead of adding it as usual.
