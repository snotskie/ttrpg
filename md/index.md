## Introduction
<!-- _class: center major -->

### About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

## Making Your First Character
<!-- _class: center major creation -->

### Character Creation ¬∑ Step One!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe the **Stats** used in *Humanity, Blessed*, known collectively as **the H's of Humanity**. Your GM may add an additional one as well.

Your first task is to decide **which Stat your character is best at**. You can find a **Character Sheet** at the end of this book to help you track your choices.

As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. **Why are they good at this and not at that?** Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

When you begin the game, most of your Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Checks. However, the Stat you chose as your **highest Stat begins the game one die size larger**. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Stat Dice.

All of your Stat Dice may be **upgraded later in the Session Shop** section later in this chapter.

### Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

All characters in this game have the following Stats, each related to a different "scope" of action:

| üß† Head Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music, picking locks. *High/Low:* With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. But with a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach. |

| ‚úåÔ∏è Hand Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Athletic pursuits, endurance, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly, pickpocketing. *High/Low:* With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. But with a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üíï Heart Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally, creating expressive art, performing sleights of hand for an audience. *High/Low:* With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. But with a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are. |

| ‚òï Home Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Protecting yourself and loved ones, tending to illness and wounds, shopping, crafting, scavenging, camping, cooking, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. *High/Low:* With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. But with a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you seem to always misplace things. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëø Hurt Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. *High/Low:* With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. But with a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies. |

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. *High/Low:* With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. But with a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like. |

| ‚è≥ History Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, and hardships covered by your Backstory, as well as other aspects covered by the history of your people and not covered by your other Stats. *High/Low:* With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialization you set out to achieve. But with a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often. |

### Optional Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

Your GM may add one of the following Stats to your game, depending on the game's setting and tone:

| ü™∂ Hex Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *Setting:* Magic or fantasy. |

| ü•ï Ham Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *Setting:* Cartoon. |

| üîé Hunch Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *Setting:* Film noir. |

| ü¶æ Hardware Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *Setting:* Cyberpunk. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëæ Hologram Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. *Setting:* Futuristic. |

| üí∞ Hireling Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *Setting:* Absurd capitalist. |

| üéÅ Holly Jolly Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *Setting:* Winter wonderland. |

| üéß Headline Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *Setting:* Battle of the bands. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| ü¶† Host Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. *Effect:* When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while using this Stat, receive $+2$ in aid. There may be consequences. *Setting:* Alien paranormal suspense. |

| üíÄ Hardship Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. *Effect:* This Stat cannot be only be a $d4$. *Setting:* Suspense horror. |

| üëª Haunted Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. *Effect:* This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, and can only be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d2$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. *Setting:* Poe style. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üå≥ Hardy Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements emerging from each session's obstacles and players' combined efforts against the challenges they've faced. *Effect:* This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d2$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy Stat Die instead of one of their other Stat Dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d2$. *Setting:* Coming of age. |

| ‚ö´ Haze Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. *Effect:* This die begins the game as a $d2$ and only changes when the character fails certain Checks or loses certain Contests against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat Die instead of their own usual die for the roll. *Setting:* Psychological horror. |

### Stat Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each of a character's Stats is represented by a Stat Die.

In general:

- **Die Sizes:** A Stat Die can be one of five sizes, ranging from $d2$ to $d10$, as described in the Stat Dice Notation table below.
- **Stat Dice "Bump":** Stat Dice in this game "bump." This means that when you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again and add the new result to the previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.
- **Skill and Determination:** Success and victory without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination or focus on the action.
- **Balanced Stats:** When two Stats use the same size Stat Die, they are "balanced."
- **Unconventional Stats:** Whenever an effect has you use a Stat, you may instead use any other Stat you have balanced with it, referred to as using an "unconventional Stat."
- **History Stat:** You may always choose to use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes (described later in this chapter).
- **Sparking:** You may "Spark" two balanced Stats together to create a more powerful effect (described in the Playing the Game chapter).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Stat Dice Notation

| Notation | Stat Die |
| -------- | -------- |
| $d10$ | A ten-sided die. The largest die size in the game. |
| $d8$  | An eight-sided die. |
| $d6$  | A six-sided die. |
| $d4$  | A four-sided die. |
| $d2$  | Any of the above dice, treating any odd number as $1$ and any even number as $2$. The smallest die size in the game. |

Also note:

- **Bumping Dice Groups:** Some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.
- **Explicit Dice Grouping Only:** Note, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Character Creation ¬∑ Step Two!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe **Lifestyle** and **Ethic** options. Some Lifestyles are **upgrade options** you will not have access to when the game begins.

As you read them, begin to describe the life your character had **growing up** and their **current outlook** on the world. You may also want to consult the **Playing the Game chapter** to learn more about the rules Lifestyles interact with.

Then, pick one of the **Lifestyles** with the `Starter` label and one of the **Ethics** to begin the game with. These can be changed later in the **Session Shop**.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

Once you've chosen your starter Lifestyle and Ethic, **two of your Stats** will begin the game an additional **die size larger**, according to your starter Lifestyle and Ethic. Consult the Lifestyle/Ethic Starting Stats table below to know which Stats to increase.

#### Lifestyle/Ethic Starting Stats

### GM Guide ¬∑ Campaign Ethic
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you begin to imagine the world and genre of your campaign, consider what it means to be "Carefree," "Eager," or "Wisened" in your setting. Doing so requires making assumptions about the Ethic of the world itself!

**‚öîÔ∏è Vice &amp; Virtue** settings are well equipped for high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories. This is likely the most familiar genre for your players, especially for good vs. evil stories. The Blossomed, Driven, and Steadfast upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge** settings are well equipped for dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror. This genre resists feeling familiar, as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. The Prodigious, Chosen, and Warry upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability** settings are well equipped for cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories. This genre is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without necessarily a clear good vs. evil component. The Crafty, Wired, and Compelling upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

### Character Creation ¬∑ Step Three!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe your character's story before, coming into, and outside of the game's main story. **Answer the following prompts** or others given to you by your GM.

These background details will help you and your GM build the story and set your **Backstory**, which is used by your **History Stat** and is described in more detail in the following pages.

For now:

- Describe **who your character looks up to**, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
- List **three specific skills** that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
- List **three specific people or groups** that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
- Describe **where your character could be found** on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
- If your game's setting has **non-human characters** and your character is one of them, work with your GM to determine how your non-human background affects your Backstory or the scope of your Stats.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

And as you play, **keep notes**! These can help you reflect on you and your group's shared "Group History," as well as your **character's relationship to the Group History**. Maybe not everyone in the party is enthused about the items the party stole last time!

Such reflection can help you **shape the course** of your Backstory and your character's development over the duration of the story, **make important character choices** during your sessions, and **inspire you and your GM** for ideas for future scenes and sessions.

### Backstory
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each character has a Backstory, a list  or description of narrative elements from their background that help define the scope of their unique History Stat. For example: Tying Knots (for a scout), Swordfighting (for a knight), Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn), Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician), Acting (for a theater kid), Manipulating Technology (for a hacker), Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer), Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the empire), Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the empire).

In general: 

- **Unique:** Your Backstory should define unique skills, proficiencies, traits, and narrative elements that your character brings to the story.
- **Variety:** Your Backstory should have enough variety that not all or most of your Backstory would already be covered by a single Stat.
- **History Stat:** You may always choose to use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes (described later in this chapter).

### Non-Human Characters
<!-- _class: rules -->

If your game's setting allows you to play non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent it.

The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds among players:

- **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's Backstory to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their background could perform unaided that humans couldn't.
- **Low Variety:** If the player characters come from just a few non-human backgrounds, the GM may expand the scope of two or three Stats to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that humans couldn't.

### Character Creation ¬∑ Step Four!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe **Aptitudes** and **Specializations**.

You won't begin the game with Specializations or Abilities, but you will begin the game with a number of Aptitudes drawn from your Backstory.

To help you select the Aptitudes you will start the game with, begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. **Have you seen characters like them before** in movies, TV shows, books, or video games? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

Then with that in mind **select two** areas from your Backstory to begin the game "apt" in. If you begin the game with a Stat Die of size $d8$, **select a third** area as well. You be more likely succeed and win at these areas.

You may also become apt in additional areas or further **specialize** your apt areas in the **Session Shop** later. Specalizations will grant you **customized Abilities**.

### Aptitudes and Specializations
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters in this game may have a number of Abilities that provide them with new effects, bonuses, actions or so on, based on their Aptitudes and Specializations, described below. The end of this chapter lists sample Abilities, which refer to rules described in the next chapter. However, for now you should know:

- **Aptitudes:** Your Aptitudes are the important and often unique narrative areas you are "apt" in.
- **Aptitude Aid:** When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest related enough to an area you are apt in, receive $+2$ in aid.
- **History Stat:** You may always choose to use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes.
- **Specializations:** Your Specializations are the Aptitudes you have "specialized," which grant you unique Abilities depending on the nature of the specialization.
- **Specializing in an Aptitude:** You may specialize your Aptitudes in the Session Shop. When you do, you choose how you specialize it, based on the events of the story so far or how you would like to see your character grow. First, select an Ability from the options listed on the following pages. Then, explain how that Ability relates to the Aptitude you are specializing in. Finally, at GM discretion, you gain that Ability or an adjusted version of it.
- **Specialization Limits:** You may not specialize the same Aptitude area more than once or choose the same Specialization more than once.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

For example:

1. **Starting Aptitude:** Dave is a rookie cop. During his time in training, he became apt at Obstacles Courses.
2. **Choosing Specialization:** Then over the course of the story, he specialized his Obstacles Course Aptitude further, with an interest in taking the Friendly Specialization. 
3. **Explaining Specialization:** Dave's player explains how Dave has a close relationship with his sneakers, which should be able to grant him bonuses on his Checks and Contests beyond just running through Obstacle Courses, due to the storied history he shares with his shoes and the power of their bond.
4. **Customized Ability:** The GM agrees, and adjusts the Friendly Specialization to fit the setting and the new Backstory elements about Dave and his sneakers. The GM specifies how much aid Dave's "sneaker companion" provides to which Stats and adds this customized Ability to Dave's character sheet.
5. **Shared Storytelling:** Finally, the GM and Dave's player chat further about the flavor of this Specialization to help the GM prepare for the next session.

### Character Creation ¬∑ Finishing Touches!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Finally, **describe your character's appearance** and list **three or four items** your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you begin the game with.

You'll track a list of items that you typically carry with you, and other items you may have can be **determined in the moment**: Over the course of the story, you may perform Checks to **find** new items, **create** new items, **purchase and sell** items, and even see if you **already have** items that could be narratively reasonable for you to have.

And while most items are narrative, some **higher quality items** you acquire along the way may provide aid or effects similar to some Abilities. If you don't begin the game with a Stat Die of size $d8$, **choose one item** to begin the game at a higher quality so that it provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect.


### Session Shop Upgrades
<!-- _class: ability -->

At the end of each session, you receive one free Stat Upgrade for your character. This may then grant you additional upgrades from the other options described below.

| Stat Upgrade `One Free` |
| --- |
| *Effect:* Upgrade a single Stat's die one size. |
| *Limits:* You may have at most two Stat Dice of size $d10$ and at most three of size $d8$. |
| *Purchase More:* You may receive an additional Stat Upgrade by spending ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† or by downgrading one of your Stat Dice from a $d4$ to a $d2$. You may purchase additional Stat Upgrades as many times as you want and can pay for. |
| *Other Upgrades:* When you upgrade a Stat Die to a $d6$, $d8$, or $d10$ you may receive one upgrade with the `d6`, `d8`, or `d10` tag, respectively. |

| High-Quality Upgrade `d6` |
| ------------ |
| *Effect:* One of your mundane items becomes higher quality. It now provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect. |

| Backstory Upgrade `d6` |
| --- |
| *Effect:* Make up to two changes or additions to your Backstory. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Ability Upgrade `d8` |
| --- |
| *Effect:* Become apt in a new area or further specialize in an area you're already apt in. |

| Powered Upgrade `d10` |
| ------------ |

| *Effect:* If your Lifestyle is Wisened, change your Lifestyle to Steadfast, Warry, or Compelling. |

| Lost Upgrade `d10` |

| --- |
| During a Contest against another individual, before either character rolls, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to act synchronously with your opponent. If you do, the two of you perform your rolls at the same time. When either of you would bump, you both bump. You both still maintain your own separate roll totals. This Ability may not be used at the start of an Endeavor round or doing scrambling Contest rules. |

## Playing the Game
<!-- _class: center major rules -->

### Checks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Most situations in this game can be resolved by performing a Check or a Contest (described later in this chapter).

To perform a Check:

1. **GM Discretion:** The GM will let you know which Stat is normally associated with the action and a target number you will need to hit based on the difficulty of the action, as described in the Check Targets table below.
2. **Choose Stat:** Choose a Stat to roll. Your options are the Stat normally associated with the action, any Stat you have balanced with that Stat, or History if the action is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes.
3. **Roll:** Roll your Stat Die for the chosen Stat.
4. **Outcome:** If the result of the roll meets or beats the GM's target number, then the Check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

#### Check Targets

| Difficulty | Target |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Easy | $4$ |
| Medium | $8$ |
| Hard | $12$ |
| Severe | $16$ |
| Trial | $20$ |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Medium Difficulty:** A "Medium difficult" target is considered the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into.
- **Adjusted Difficulty:** For situations where the GM surprises the players and they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, it is recommended the GM lower the difficulty by $1$ to $3$ because such Checks are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.

### GM Guide ¬∑ Setting Targets for Magic
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your setting has "magic" or other supernatural, reality-bending player capabilities, the way you set targets for these Checks depends on the nature of "magic" in your setting. 

We recommend providing your players a table that describes your "magic" targets for them:

- Each row of the table corresponds to a Check target, from Easy to Severe.
- Each column corresponds to a "school of magic" or category of supernatural effect.
- Each cell describes examples of what a supernatural action of that Check target and category might look like.
- Players and you determine which cells are most like what the player wants to achieve with their effect, and the highest Check target among those cells is the Check target their roll will need to meet, with you having final say on the exact Check target.
- Increase the Check target they need to hit if they are pushing the area, duration, or nature of the effect further than normal; if they are untrained in the effect or it is outside their "school of magic"; or if the effect requires forbidden knowledge.
- Performing supernatural effects requiring beyond a Severe Check target requires a "quest" to do so.

### Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Abilities and other effects cost "Blessing Dice" to activate.

In general:

- **Pool of Blessing Dice:** Each character has a pool of Blessing Dice, representing resources they can draw upon when the moment calls.
- **Gaining Blessing Dice:** The GM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements, described in the Blessing Dice Opportunities table below. When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice.
- **Spending Blessing Dice:** When you spend a Blessing Die, remove it from your pool of Blessing Dice. An effect may require you to spend a Blessing Die of at least a certain size. An effect may also require you to spend multiple Blessings at the same time. The Blessing Dice Notation table below provides a few examples of how Blessing costs are notated.
- **Blessing Dice Bump:** Like your Stat Dice, Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way. When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.
- **Gain One at a Time:** If you gain multiple Blessings from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Blessing Dice Notation

| Notation | Blessing Dice |
| -------- | ------------- |
| ‚ë• | A Blessing Die worth $6$. The largest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë° | A Blessing Die worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë† | A Blessing Die worth $1$ or more. The smallest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë°‚ë° | Two Blessing Dice each worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | Two Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚ë† $\times 4$ | Four Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚äú‚äú | Two Blessing Dice of the same worth. |

#### Blessing Dice Opportunities

| Opportunity | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Milestones | Gain a number of Blessings for completing important story milestones. |
| Creativity | Gain a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions. |
| High Roll | Gain a Blessing Die the first time each session you succeed a Check with a Medium or higher target or win a Contest with a Medium or higher outcome size. Each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high roll also gains a Blessing. |

### Recharge
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Abilities list a recharge Blessing cost. Once activated, these Abilities cannot be activated again until they have been recharged by paying that cost.

### Helping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters may spend their Blessings to attempt to Help one another complete Checks and Contests. And your Abilities, events, and items in the story may also Help you in similar ways.

To provide Help:

1. **Note the Success/Victory Gap:** Make note of how much higher the character needs to roll to achieve their goals: to succeed the Check or win the Contest (described below) with at least a certain outcome size (also described below). This amount is the "success/victory gap."
2. **Pay Help Cost:** Once per roll, whether your own or another character's, when your character could reasonably assist with the action and is not currently engaged in another action, you may attempt to Help by spending ‚ìç, where $X$ is the success/victory gap.
3. **Attempt Help:** Then, the character you Helped performs their roll again. If the new roll is higher than their current roll, their roll takes the new value or the value they were originally trying to reach, whichever is lower.
4. **Additional Help:** The Help gained above can lower the success/victory gap, reducing the cost to Help the character further, if there are additional characters nearby who have not Helped them yet and are willing to pay the cost.

### Receiving Situational Aid
<!-- _class: rules -->

While you and your allies may spend Blessings to attempt to Help one another, in certain situations your Abilities, items, environment, careful planning, or so on can provide you additional Help of a different sort&mdash;for free!

- **Receive Aid:** Situational aid effects describe a possible failed Check or lost Contest and say to "receive $+X$ in aid" in response. When you do, you gain a $+X$ bonus to the roll, as though you were Helped by the situation, possibly turning the failure into a success or loss into a win.

Also note:

- **One Aid at a Time:** You may only receive situational aid once per roll. If multiple effects would provide situational aid during the same roll, you choose which one to use.

### Spark Rolls
<!-- _class: rules -->

A pair of balanced Stats and can be "Sparked" together, representing hints of magic, ability to achieve amazing feats, surprising wins, and so on. Sparks are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination&mdash;and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

In general, Spark rolls work by grouping Stat Dice and rolling them, increasing the odds of bumping. To perform a Spark roll:

1. **Spark a Roll:** Before rolling a Stat Die, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to perform a Spark roll instead, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each.
2. **Apply Usual Bonuses:** Any bonuses or effects that would apply to either of the balanced Stats used in the Spark roll also apply to the Spark roll itself.

Alternatively, you can upgrade an existing roll into a Spark roll:

1. **Roll Normally:** Roll one Stat Die, bumping and applying bonuses as usual.
2. **Upgrade to Spark:** Then, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to add a second Stat Die to the roll that is balanced with the first. Roll the second Stat Die, add the result to the first, and if the second one bumps, both bump as a group.

The second approach rolls lower on average, but doesn't require you to commit to the cost up front.

### Overcharged Stats
<!-- _class: rules -->

Lifestyle upgrade options overcharge one or two of a character's Stats, which provides situational aid.

- **Overcharged:** When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while performing a Spark roll using an overcharged Stat, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ is half the size of the die used in the Spark roll.

### Coming Prepared
<!-- _class: rules -->

You may perform a Home Check to see if you already came prepared with just the item you need.

The target needed for such Checks is up to GM discretion. However, in general:

- **Suspension of Disbelief:** The target you will need to reach may depend on details such as how common, niche, specialized, rare, or unique in the world the desired item is; how probable it would be to already have that item; and how many items your character already has listed. These sorts of details greatly affect the suspension of disbelief that your character really could have the item in question.
- **Risk of Failure:** When you fail a Check to see if you already came prepared with an item, you may be unable to perform these Checks again until the end of the scene or session. And if you fail by a large amount, you may drop or break other items in your possession while digging around in your bag, alert others to your location, or so on.

### Shopping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Performing Home Checks to shop, trade, or so on is similar to performing Home Checks to see if you already came prepared with an item.

In general for shopping:

- **Stocked Shops Provide Aid:** If you are shopping in a place where it would be reasonable to find the desired item, and if would be reasonable for you to have the money or goods to trade for that item, then you may receive situational aid on the Check.
- **Risk of Failure:** Like coming prepared, if you fail a Check to shop, you may be unable to do so again until the end of the scene or session, you may lose one of your other items in a bad deal, you may anger shopkeepers or be accused of shoplifting, or so on.

### Crafting
<!-- _class: rules -->

Crafting new items from your surroundings, tools, and supplies is a long action. This is because crafting usually requires a number of tasks that span the scope of multiple Stats:

For example:

- **Home:** Gathering high quality supplies.
- **Head:** Gaining knowledge of how to construct the desired object.
- **Hand or Home:** Gathering or constructing the necessary tools.
- **Hand:** Constructing the desired object, which can involve multiple steps depending on the complexity.
- **Heart:** Improvising adjustments when tools or supplies break or when one's initial plans were imperfect.
- **Hex, Ham, Hologram, or so on:** Meddling with the forces of the universe (for settings that have a Stat for the "magic" of the world).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

In general:

- **Quality:** The target you will need to hit for this craft long action will depend on the intended "quality" or effect of your desired item, as described in the Crafted Item Quality table below. Items that would require Trial-level difficulty usually require substantial roleplay, effort, or "quests" beyond performing Checks.
- **Flaws:** Crafted items may come with flaws, even if you succeed overall. How flaws are introduced depends on how the GM chooses to resolve the craft long action.
- **Simple Flaws:** The GM may provide two targets for you to hit. To succeed you will need to hit the lower target, but to succeed without flaws or limitations you will need to hit the higher target.
- **Thorough Flaws:** The GM may require you to make multiple Checks. To succeed at crafting you will need to succeed on at least half of the individual Checks, with each failed Check introducing the chance for a flaw or limitation.

#### Crafted Item Quality

| Item quality | Typical difficulty | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Mundane | Easy or Medium | Narrative function only |
| High-Quality Mundane | Medium or Hard | Provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect |
| Powered | Severe | Provides a "receive $+2$ in aid" effect |

### Setting Out
<!-- _class: rules -->

You and your fellow players may propose plans that could direct how you set out on a series of scenes, sessions, or whole campaign. When you do, the GM may ask for a set of rolls similar to a group long action.

- **Making Plans:** Each roll in this group long action will correspond to a different necessary step of your group's plans.
- **Gather Information:** Then, based on the results, the GM may provide different amounts or types of information to set you off on your "quest," representing your group's capabilities at planning and preparation.

### Fortune Checks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some situations require characters to have luck on their side beyond mere skill, to have "made" their own luck by coming prepared, or to have already built up enough good karma.

To perform a Fortune Check:

1. **Blessing Cost:** The GM sets a Blessing cost for an action, such as deactivating a complex trap, finding a hiding spot during pitched combat, or passing through a spectral guardian's door.
2. **Gain Temporary Blessings:** Then perform the relevant Check for the action. Gain a number of temporary Blessings equal to half your roll, rounded down.
3. **Pay Blessing Cost:** Then, if possible, pay the Blessing cost and succeed the Fortune Check. If you are unable or unwilling to pay the cost, the Fortune Check fails.
4. **Lose Temporary Blessings:** Finally, any remaining temporary Blessings disappear.

### Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Contests are similar to Checks, but performed against another character. There are two types of Contests: violent and non-violent.

- **Violent Contest:** A violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character's will using Hurt. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially dangerous. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.
- **Non-violent Contest:** A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character's will using any Stat besides Hurt.

To perform a Contest:

1. **Attack:** The Attacker rolls the appropriate Stat.
2. **Defense:** The Defender chooses a Stat to roll, according to the Stat used by the Attacker and the Defense Options table below.
3. **Help Effects:** If the Attacker, Defender, or either of their allies have Help effects, resolve these effects one at a time, first "receive aid" effects, then Defender Help, then Attacker Help.
4. **Outcome:** The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The size of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores according to the Outcome Sizes and Contest Effects tables below.
5. **Defender Victory:** In some Contests, at GM discretion, when the Defender wins by enough, they may receive an outcome as though they were the Attacker instead. By default however, Defender victory simply nullifies the Attack's intended effect.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Defense Options

| Attacker Rolls | Defender Roll Options |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Hurt | <ul><li>Hurry</li><li>Any Stat balanced with Hurry</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with Hurry</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |
| Hurry | <ul><li>Hurt</li><li>Any Stat balanced with Hurt</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with Hurt</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |
| History | <ul><li>GM decides</li></ul> |
| Anything else | <ul><li>Same Stat as Attacker</li><li>Any Stat balanced with that Stat</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with that Stat</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |

#### Outcome Sizes

| Outcome size | Roll this much more than your opponent |
| --- | --- |
| Very Minor | $0-1$ |
| Minor | $2-3$ |
| Medium | $4-5$ |
| Major | $6-7$ |
| Very Major | $8-9$ |
| Maximum | $10+$ |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

#### Contest Effects

| Outcome size | Contest effect |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Very Minor or Minor | Attacker gets what they want, with complications, and the advantage is momentary. |
| Medium | Attacker gets what they want, without complications, and the advantage lasts several rolls or shifts the narrative of the scene. |
| Major or Very Major | Attacker gets what they want, shifting the narrative arc of the session or several sessions. The ramifications of negative effects may be serious though not life-threathening. |
| Maximum | Attacker has likely gone too far for what they intended. Negative effects are serious, possibly needing immediate attention or miracle, shifting the narrative arc of several sessions or the campaign. |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Checks vs. Contests:** Checks use the terms "fail," "succeed," and "target," while Contests use "lose," "win," "Attack," "Defend," and "outcome size" instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks.

### Group Checks and Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group. There are two general approaches:

- **Provide Help:** One way is to provide Help to one roll that leads the group's action. Some members of the group may decide not to roll and instead wait for the group leader to roll, then provide Help to the leader by spending Blessings to let the leader reroll.
- **Median Roll:** Another way is for each character to roll for the action, using the median of their rolls as the group's shared result. If the group roll had an even number of individual rolls, then the higher of the two median rolls is used. The Group Median Rolls table below provides a quick reference.

#### Group Median Rolls

| Rolls made | Roll used |
| ---------- | --------- |
| $2$ | Highest |
| $3$ | Second highest |
| $4$ | Second highest |
| $5$ | Third highest |
| $6$ | Third highest |
| $7$ | Fourth highest |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Mixing Group Strategies:** These two approaches may be combined, with some members rolling and taking their median, and the other members providing Help to let the lower-rolling members attempt their rolls again. However, a group member cannot both roll and Help for the same action.
- **Staying Grouped:** In general, once characters become a group as part of a Check or Contest, they remain a group until the end of the Check or Contest and are treated as a single character for the sake of the rules, sharing benefits and risks.
- **Opponent Groups:** Also note, a character cannot force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

### Complex Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes a character's Attack is itself a complex action normally requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

1. **Complex Attack Threshold:** In complex Attacks, the GM may set a threshold the Attacker needs to clear. The Attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the GM's threshold. This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to clear the threshold.
2. **Adjusted Outcome Size:** If both characters roll lower than the threshold, the outcome is determined as though the Defender had rolled that threshold instead.

### Delayed Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes Attacks are made that are Defended against at a later time, such as setting traps or sending letters.

Such delayed Attacks are performed as Contests as usual with the following adjustments:

- **Delay:** The Attacker performs their roll, decribes what condition would activate the Attack, and writes these both down.
- **Activate:** The Defender rolls against the Attacker's roll whenever the Attack would be activated.

Also note:

- **Limited Attacker Aid:** The Attacker cannot activate "receive aid" effects if they are not present when the Attack is activated. The Defender can still activate "receive aid" effects as usual.

### Long Actions
<!-- _class: rules -->

A long action is any action that is multi-step, spans a longer period of time than most other actions, and involves the scope of multiple Stats. For example, formulating a plan for a heist, engaging in political intrigue, piloting a crewed vessel, or running a business.

There are two approaches the GM may take to resolve long actions:

- **Simple Long Action:** The GM may ask for a single Check or Contest, using only the single Stat that the long action's success or victory most turns on. The bar for success or victory without difficulties or complications may be higher than usual in this case.
- **Thorough Long Action:** The GM may ask for multiple Checks or Contests using the various Stats involved in the long action. For overall success or victory, at least half of these rolls will need to win or succeed. However, each failure or loss may incur difficulties or complications on top of that success.

### Scrambling Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Contests are fast and chaotic, with both sides rapidly changing their plans and the Stats that would be involved&mdash;yet without amounting to the level of tension covered by Eneavors described later in this chapter. For example, quick bouts, fisticuffs, cartoonish outbreaks of "violence," and short and dramatic card games.

To perform a scrambling Contest:

1. **Half-Baked Attacks:** Quickly choose a Stat to roll, as though you were Attacking. The narrative for your Attacks do not have to be fully formed&mdash;just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats may be chosen for this Contest.
2. **Scramble:** If you rolled highest, you choose how to "scramble" the Contest. Choose which Stats everyone uses for the next roll, and you may choose different Stats for different characters. You just can't choose a Stat for a character that the character has already rolled this Contest. 
3. **Repeat:** Repeat the above step until a character has no Stats left to roll.
4. **Final Round:** If you rolled the highest during the final round of rolls, you win the overall Contest. But if you rolled very low on any of your rolls in previous rounds, then your victory may have complications.
5. **Outcome Size:** Narrate and determine the final outcome of the Contest. The outcome is determined using your final roll as an Attack and everyone else's rolls as a group Defense.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Scrambling Sparks:** If a character Sparks a roll during a scrambling Contest, the Spark roll must involve the Stat chosen for the character to use, it may not involve a Stat the character has already rolled for that Contest, and for the sake of the scrambling Contest it uses up both Stats involved.

### General Endeavor Rules
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes, the player characters will need to race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on! Many such scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

There are several different types of Endeavors depending on the scenario. However, all Endeavors build on these same general rules:

- **Rounds:** Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents.
- **Roll:** At the start of each round, choose a Stat to roll. The narrative for your rolls do not have to be fully formed, just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Current Roll:** Once you roll, you'll use this roll value for all Checks and Contests for the rest of the round&mdash;or until an effect makes you reroll! So, it is important to keep track of your current roll. 
- **Turn Order:** After rolls are made for the round, if you rolled the lowest you go first. Then whoever hasn't acted yet and holds the lowest current roll goes next, with the GM resolving ties, until all characters have gone.

<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Actions:** Each round during your turn, you may only take one action, chosen from the set of actions available for that Endeavors. Some actions use your current roll, and some ignore it. The GM may limit the actions you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Movement:** Endeavors use a "track", represented as a number line, to record character positions, scores, progress towards goals, or so on. This track begins at $0$ and goes up as high as needed. The Endeavor's setup instructions will describe where characters begin on the track, and its actions will describe when and how you move.
- **Group Movement:** If a group moves together an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.
- **Special Actions:** Some actions have the `Special Action` label. Special actions cannot be used during the round. Instead, at the end of the round after all normal actions are complete, whoever has the highest current roll chooses a special action to perform, with the GM resolving ties. Then the next round begins and new rolls are made.
- **Buttons:** Endeavors add a number of buttons to the track. There are two types of buttons, personal and global. Personal buttons can only be activated by the character who added them, whereas global buttons can be activated by any character. If an Endeavor uses buttons, it will describe how each is activated and the effect that happens as a result.

<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note:

- **Helping Yourself:** During your turn, before you use your current roll to take your action, you may spend Blessings as usual to attempt to increase the value of your current roll, so long as you have not already done so that round.
- **Sparking:** You may also spend ‚äú‚äú as usual to upgrade your current roll to a Spark roll before your action. Use these to your advantage to jump ahead of your opponents to nab the special action for the round!
- **Streamlined Success:** To streamline Endeavors, the GM allow all Checks to automatically succeed, providing larger effects for higher rolls.
- **Receiving Aid:** If the GM does streamline Checks this way, then "recieve aid" effects would be unable to activate. At GM discretion, such effects may never activate, always activate, or only activate once per Endeavor per effect.
- **Multiple Tracks:** If an Endeavor spans a larger playing field than normal, the GM may divide the Endeavor into two or three tracks, where who you can interact with is limited based on which track you are on. Depending on the situation, you may be able to change tracks by performing a Fortune Check. In any case, the Endeavor still only has one special action per round across all tracks.

### GM Guide ¬∑ Large-Scale Endeavors
<!-- _class: guide -->

Resolving actions that occur on massive scales&mdash;such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster&mdash;requires shifting the scale of the narrative.

This may be done in an Endeavor by spending one round at the large-scale action before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them for the next several rounds.

The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

### üõ°Ô∏è Clash Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters summoning, rallying, or inspiring allies to face off against an opposing side's summoned, rallied, or inspired allies&mdash;such as soldiers in your command, athletes you are coaching, creature companions you have befriended, knights dueling as your champions, spirits you are channeling, or spectral monsters you've summoned by playing music so well!

- **Setup:** You, your allies, and your opponents do not have a position. Instead, both sides begin the Endeavor with two "summons" on their side at position $1$. A "summon" is a character or other entity you have summoned to your side for the Endeavor, and a "summoner" is any character or group summoning others to their side. Generally a summon is considered to have existed before they were summoned to your side&mdash;"being summoned" just places them into the game's evolving story.
- **Goal:** You win when your summons have captured enough opposing summons.

### GM Guide ¬∑ Monstrosities
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **Stat Dice:** A Monstrosity has a highest die (HD) shared between all their strongest Stats and lower dice one or two die sizes smaller for all the rest.
- **Defenses:** A Monstrosity also has a starting position (SP) and one or two recovery buttons. For compactness, for example, if a Monstrosity is said to have an SP of $10 (3)$, then it enters at position $10$ and has a recovery button $3$ below that starting position. If it has an SP of $30 (10, 15)$, then it enters at position $30$ and has recovery buttons at $10$ and $15$ below that starting position. Together, a Monstrosity's SP and recovery buttons represent its defenses, similar to the concept of "hit points" and "shields" used in other games.
- **Offenses:** A Monstrosity has a Capture Roll (CR) value used when it performs Inflict Wounds. This provides more consistent difficulty levels for Endeavors. A Monstrosity may also have one or two Abilities that provide additional offensive actions.
- **Resources:** Finally, a Monstrosity may enter the Endeavor with a number of Blessings (B). These are only used by a Monstrosity to provide Help or Spark a roll.
- **Experience:** In games with experience points (XP), a Monstrosity contributes an amount of XP toward Endeavor rewards when it is defeated. Track the highest XP the party has earned from any Endeavor, and when they reach a new XP record, award the party a total number of Blessings equal to the amount the XP record increased by. 

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **Building Monstrous Endeavors:** To build memorable, balanced, and challenging Monstrous Endeavors, include two or three different types of Monstrosities per Endeavor, at various tiers of difficulty and/or with different types of abilities. Also, being outnumbered *quickly* increases the difficulty and complexity, even if most of the Monstrosities are very weak! To help manage this complexity, give a lay of the land describing the different types of tracks the Endeavor starts with and how they relate.
- **Building Monstrosities:** The following Monstrosity Stats and Monstrosity Ability tables provide a starting point for creating Monstrosities at different tiers of difficulty:

#### Monstrosity Stats

| Difficulty | HD | SP | CR | B | XP |
| ---------- | -- | -- | -- | - | -- |
| Trivial | $d4$ | $5-10 (5-10)$ | $4$ | $0$ | $1-6$ |
| Easy | $d6$ | $10-15 (5-15)$ | $4$ | $0$ | $7-12$ |
| Medium | $d6$ | $15-20 (5-15)$ | $6$ | $0$ | $13-18$ |
| Hard | $d8$ | $20-25 (5-15)$ | $6$ | $3$ | $19-24$ |
| Severe | $d8$ | $20-30 (15-20)$ | $8$ | $3$ | $25-30$ |

### Conditions
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on, beyond mere injury. When these happen, you may become Disarmed, Surprised, Uncool, or any of the other Conditions described in the Condition Effects table below.

In general however:

- **Conditions Tell Stories:** At minimum, Conditions provide effects. However, they also represent small story arcs where you face obstacles and, in spite of the Condition's effects, overcome those obstacles. When you fail a Check or lose a Contest and gain a Condition as a result, consider how your character feels about the situation and what the Condition means to them beyond mere effect.
- **Conditions Build Connections:** Gaining and removing Conditions, and facing and overcoming obstacles, happen with other characters around. Consider, and take notes for the development of your character: Who else is around that saw the failed Check happen? How would your Hero feel about the lost Contest? And how could your connections to other characters help you remove the Condition later?
