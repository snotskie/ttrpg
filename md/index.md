## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

# Making Your First Character
<!-- _class: center major -->

## Step One: Stats
<!-- _class: center -->

> *Each character in this game has a small number of Stats: the H's of Humanity. Together, these represent a character's general capabilities at a wide range of tasks and situations.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Stats

**üß† Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music, picking locks. With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. With a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach.

**‚úåÔ∏è Hand:** Athletic pursuits, endurance, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly, pickpocketing. With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. With a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way.

**üíï Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally, creating expressive art, performing sleights of hand for an audience. With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. With a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are.

---

**‚òï Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, tending to illness and wounds, shopping, crafting, scavenging, camping, cooking, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. With a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you seem to always misplace things.

**üëø Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. With a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. With a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like.

**‚è≥ History:** Narrative touchstones representing your unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, hardships, and other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people, but not covered by or more specific than the other Stats above. With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialized training you set out to achieve. With a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often.

### Character Creation: Step One!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Your first task is to decide **which Stat your character is best at**.

As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. **Why are they good at this and not at that?** Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

When you begin the game, most of your Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Checks. However, the Stat you ranked as your **highest Stat begins the game one die size larger**. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Stat Dice.

All of your Stat Dice can be **upgraded later in the Session Shop** section at the end of this chapter.

### GM Guide: Creating Other Stats
<!-- _class: guide -->

For your campaign setting, you may find it helpful to create a new Stat for your players.

For example, you might create a Stat to represent the "magic" of the setting:

- **ü™∂ Hex:** Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *E.g., for a magic or fantasy style setting.*
- **ü•ï Ham:** Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *E.g., for a cartoon style setting.*
- **ü¶æ Hardware:** Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *E.g. for a cyberpunk style setting.*
- **üîé Hunch:** Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *E.g. for a film noir style setting.*
- **üëæ Hologram:** Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. *E.g. for a futuristic style setting.*
- **üí∞ Hireling:** Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *E.g. for an absurd capitalist style setting.*
- **üéÅ Holly Jolly:** Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *E.g. for a winter wonderland style setting.*

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **üéß Headline:** Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *E.g. for a battle of the bands style setting.*
- **ü¶† Host:** Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while using this Stat, receive $+dc2$ in aid. There may be consequences. *E.g. for an alien paranormal suspense style setting.*

Or you might create a Stat to represent how characters relate to a unique obstacle of the setting:

- **üíÄ Hardship:** Shared narrative touchstones of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. This Stat cannot be upgraded beyond a $d4$, but can still be involved in Spark rolls and be boosted by Abilities like other Stats. *E.g. for a suspense horror style setting.*
- **üëª Haunted:** Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, yet can be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d4$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. This Stat's die bumps as normal. *E.g. for a Poe style setting.*

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **üå≥ Hardy:** Shared narrative touchstones emerging from each session's obstacles that represent the players' combined efforts against the challenges they have faced. This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d4$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy die instead of one of their other Stat Dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d4$. *E.g. for a coming of age style setting.*
- **‚ö´ Haze:** Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. This die begins the game as a $dc1$ and is only increased when the character fails certain Checks or loses certain Contests against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one capped die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat Die instead of their own usual die for the roll. *E.g. for a psychological horror style setting.*

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

However, please note, if you want to create a new Stat, it must:

- Not already be covered by the first six Stats: Head, Hand, Heart, Home, Hurt, Hurry. Otherwise, you risk increasing the number of confusing moments of when one Stat applies over the other, and you risk spreading the players' resources too thin when they go to upgrade their Stats.
- Be something all players would want to upgrade (or intentionally keep low for story purposes) and function the same for all players. Otherwise, it would be simpler to cover this "Stat" with History and let the players decide who will specialize in it, how they will specialize in it, and who will leave it alone.
- Be the only new Stat you have added to your game. Otherwise, you risk creating a situation where players each have a large number of Stats that go relatively unused.
- Not sound too similar to another Stat, such as "Handling" and "Hand." Otherwise, you risk confusing situations at the table where people mishear each other.

Although Stats you create do not need to start with the letter "H," big kudos if you can keep the alliteration going!

Finally, if you create a new Stat, the Lifestyle options as written will not benefit your new Stat. So, when your players upgrade their Lifestyle and receive a benefit to one of the first six Stats, they may have that Lifestyle benefit your new Stat instead.

## Step Two: Background
<!-- _class: center -->

> *Each character in this game has a Lifestyle and a Value System. These represent characters' general backgrounds, goals, and beliefs about the world, and these can change over the course of the story.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Lifestyle and Value System

All characters have one of **thirteen Lifestyles** and one of **three Value Systems**. Descriptions for each of these can be found on the following pages.

Note, some Lifestyles are **upgrade options** you will not have access to when the game begins. As you preview these upgraded Lifestyles, you may want to consult the Playing the Game chapter to learn more about the rules they interact with. This is because all upgraded Lifestyles **overcharge** one or two of your Stats. Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while performing a Spark roll using an overcharged Stat, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ is the same sized die used in the Spark roll.

### Character Creation: Step Two!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe the life your character had **growing up** and their **current outlook** on the world.

As you do, pick one of the **Lifestyles** with the **[Starter]** label and one of the **Value Systems** to begin the game with. These can be changed later in the Session Shop.

Two of your Stats begin the game one die size larger, according to the table below and your choice of starter Lifestyle and Value System:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <th scope="col">Virtue and Vice</th>
        <th scope="col">Fate and Knowledge</th>
        <th scope="col">Cunning and Capability</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Carefree</th> <td>Heart and Hurry</td> <td>Head and Hurt</td> <td>Hand and Home</td> </tr>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Eager</th> <td>Hand and Hurt</td> <td>Heart and Home</td> <td>Head and Hurry</td> </tr>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Wisened</th> <td>Head and Home</td> <td>Hand and Hurry</td> <td>Heart and Hurt</td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Lifestyles

| üçÄ Carefree [Starter] | 
| --- |
| Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your naivete, wealthy upbringing, optimistic demeanor, or (in a darker setting) a nihilistic worldview. |

| üåº Blossomed | 
| --- |
| Your carefree nature has kept you safe from harm and surrounded by friends. When you have sparks, they might take on a free and connected aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Heart and Hurry Stats, as though you were Helped by the love and connectedness you feel for those around you. |

| üîÆ Prodigious | 
| --- |
| Your studies have come effortlessly to you, and secrets almost seem to just reveal themselves to you. When you have sparks, they might take on a sorcerous or uninhibited aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Head and Hurt Stats, as though you were Helped by a raw innate power. |

| üß∂ Crafty | 
| --- |
| You can envision amazing designs and, it seems, to bring them to life. When you have sparks, they might take on an autonomous or lucky aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Hand and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by your own sudden creativity. |

---

| üî• Eager [Starter] | 
| --- |
| Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, a person you want to impress, or a mission or faith you believe strongly in. |

| ‚öúÔ∏è Driven | 
| --- |
| Your eager drive has found purchase in a great mission or calling. When you have sparks, they might take on an incorrigible or resolute aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Hand and Hurt Stats, as though you were Helped by your own faith in your mission. |

| ‚ú® Chosen | 
| --- |
| You draw inspiration from the community around you, setting out on your journeys blessed, favored, or even cursed. When you have sparks, they might take on a divine or noble aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Heart and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by the will of the people whose lives you've touched. |

| ‚ö° Wired | 
| --- |
| Your mind is quick and analytical, and you can see solutions to problems that are unimaginably complex. When you have sparks, they might take on a calculating or duplicative aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Head and Hurry Stats, as though you were Helped by your own mind palace. |

---

| üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened [Starter] | 
| --- |
| Maybe life has not been easy on your character, but if so you've come out wiser and tougher. Perhaps you've been shaped by unfortunate events, you've dedicated yourself to your work, or (in some settings) you could take advantage of others easily because you understand how people work. |

| ü™¨ Steadfast | 
| --- |
| Your wise steadiness and alertness have made you adept at warding off harm and protecting your loved ones. When you have sparks, they might take on a firm or dispelling aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Head and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by your care for others. |

| üëÅÔ∏è Warry | 
| --- |
| You are one with the natural and supernatural worlds around you, and you have a keen sense of danger and safety. When you have sparks, they might take on an astral or prophetic aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Hand and Hurry Stats, as though you were Helped by knowledge only you could know in that moment. |

| üëÑ Compelling | 
| --- |
| You seem able to spin any loss into a win&mdash;or vice versa&mdash;, and you are a sly, tactical force to be reckoned with. When you have sparks, they might take on an illusory or vicious aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your Heart and Hurt Stats, as though you were Helped by your own ambition. |

---

| üíé Lost |
| --- |
| You feel a disconnect from your own past or former sense of self, perhaps because of an exile from your home, an erased memory, or a period of transition or deep self-reflection. When you have sparks, they might take on an erratic or liminal aspect. This Lifestyle overcharges your History Stat, as though you were Helped by your quest for self-discovery. |

### Value Systems

| ‚öîÔ∏è Virtue and Vice | 
| --- |
| Deep down, you may believe that there is good in the world and that no matter how terrible the world gets, the people who are good will win in the end. You may also believe that people who live with virtue are able to live in harmony together, while excess vice manifests itself as a clear and knowable "darkness." |

| üåí Fate and Knowledge | 
| --- |
| What drives your actions may be a firm belief that your personal traits dictate your destiny, not whether you are "good," and that personal traits can never really be changed. You may also believe that your destiny can be altered to your liking by making the right deal, adhering to the right discipline, or acquiring the right knowledge‚Äîends justify the means after all. |

| ‚öôÔ∏è Cunning and Capability | 
| --- |
| At the end of the day, you may believe that the only person you can really trust is yourself. You may also believe that the world is unfair, "good" and "fate" are made up ideas, and you'd do whatever it takes to just get by. |

### GM Guide: Campaign Value System
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you begin to imagine the world and genre of your campaign, consider what it means to be "Carefree," "Eager," or "Wisened" in your setting. Doing so requires making assumptions about the Value System of the world itself!

**‚öîÔ∏è Virtue and Vice** settings are well equipped for high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories. This is likely the most familiar genre for your players, especially for good vs. evil stories. The Blossomed, Driven, and Steadfast upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**üåí Fate and Knowledge** settings are well equipped for dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror. This genre resists feeling familiar, as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. The Prodigious, Chosen, and Warry upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**‚öôÔ∏è Cunning and Capability** settings are well equipped for cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories. This genre is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without necessarily a clear good vs. evil component. The Crafty, Wired, and Compelling upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

## Step Three: History
<!-- _class: center -->

> *Each character has a History Stat, made up of a number of narrative touchstones unique to only them!*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### History Stat

A character's History Stat is used to perform actions more related to their **backstory** than to their other Stats. And even though every character has a History Stat, what their History covers can vary greatly.

When both your History Stat and another Stat would be applicable in a situation, the GM may decide which applies more. Otherwise, you choose which to use.

### Group History

As you play, **keep notes**! These can help you reflect on you and your group's shared "Group History," as well as your **character's relationship to the Group History**. Maybe not everyone in the party is enthused about the items the party stole last time!

Such reflection can help you **shape the course** of your History Stat's scope and your character's development over the duration of the story, **make important character choices** during your sessions, and **inspire you and your GM** for ideas for future scenes and sessions.

### Character Creation: Step Three!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe your character's backstory. Answer the following prompts, or others given to you by your GM. These background details will help you and your GM build the story and set the scope of the narrative touchstones your History Checks cover.

- Describe **who your character looks up to**, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
- List **three specific skills** that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
- List **three specific people or groups** that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
- Describe **where your character could be found** on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
- If your game's setting has **non-human characters** and your character is one of them, work with your GM to determine how your non-human background affects the scope of your Stats.

### GM Guide: Scope of History Stat
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you work with your players to develop their backstory, come up with a list of three to five specific narrative touchstones for each player that describe what their History Stat covers. For example:

- Tying Knots (for a scout)
- Swordfighting (for a knight)
- Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn)
- Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician)
- Acting (for a theater kid)
- Manipulating Technology (for a hacker)
- Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer)
- Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the empire)
- Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the empire)

Consider what *unique* skills, proficiencies, traits, and backstory elements each character brings to the story. Also consider the *variety* of a character's narrative touchstones: if all or most of them would be covered already by another Stat, then the player would have no reason to use or upgrade their History Stat!

### GM Guide: Non-Human Characters
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your game's setting allows your players to create non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent non-human details. The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds between your players:

- **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's History Stat to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their non-human background could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.
- **Low Variety:** If player characters all come from just a few non-human background options, then using History to cover this background would clog the scope of the Stat with details that aren't unique to each player. Instead, expand the scope of two or three of the other Stats to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.

## Step Four: Abilities
<!-- _class: center -->

> *Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, Value System, and History to flesh out their key defining traits!*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Abilities

As your read more about the Abilities that follow, you may want to consult the Playing the Game chapter to learn more about the rules they interact with.

Some Abilities **require and extend** another Ability. Such Abilities cannot be gained until you've first gained the required Ability. And when you gain such an Ability, it does not count against your number of Ability Upgrades received. However, you can only extend any particular Ability once this way. If an Ability would extend an already extended Ability, it still does count against your total number of Abilities.

And some Abilities, once activated, cannot be activated again until they have been **recharged** by spending ‚ìç from your pool of Blessing Dice.

### Character Creation: Step Four!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. **Have you seen characters like them before** in movies, TV shows, and books? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

With that in mind, **pick two** of the following Abilities with the **[Starter]** label to start the game with. You can gain additional Abilities later in the Session Shop.

### GM Guide: Bless√®d Charity's Boon
<!-- _class: guide -->

How you rule the boon given by the "Bless√®d Charity" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

However, some ideas are:

- Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
- Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
- Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

## Step Five: Items
<!-- _class: center -->

> *There is not an appendix of items to choose from in this game. Instead, items are narrative and help shape the course of the story.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Items

Each character tracks a list of items they typically carry with them, and other items they may have with them can be **determined in the moment**.

Over the course of the story, characters may perform Checks to **find** new items, **create** new items, **purchase and sell** items, and even see if they **already have** items that could be narratively reasonable for them have. And while most items are narrative, some **higher quality items** you acquire along the way may provide aid or effects similar to some Abilities.

### Character Creation: Step Five!
<!-- _class: creation -->

List **three or four items** your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

### GM Guide: Creating NPCs
<!-- _class: guide -->

You do not need to go through the entire character creation process to create NPCs for your table. Instead, you only need the following and can improvise the rest:

- Scope of History Stat and History Stat Die
- What the NPC's motivation and quirks are and how they relate to two PCs' histories
- One other Stat's die that is unusually high or low compared to the rest
- One Stat Die shared by all the other Stats
- At most one Ability. If the Ability would require recharging to be used, instead roll a $d6$ as though gaining a Blessing Die. If the NPC would gain a Blessing Die worth enough to recharge the Ability, instead recharge the Ability immediately

## Afterwards: Session Shop
<!-- _class: center -->

> *Now that you've built your first character, let's play! And after your first session, keep reading to find out what upgrade options are available in the Session Shop!*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Session Shop
<!-- _class: ability -->

At the end of each session, you receive **one free upgrade** for your character. Upgrade options are listed below. Some upgrades you receive **immediately**, and some you receive at the **end of the following session**.

You may also **spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to receive an additional** upgrade beyond the one you receive for free. You can keep spending Blessings to receive additional upgrades this way, but each additional upgrade **costs ‚ë†‚ë† more** than the last.

| Stat Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may upgrade a single Stat's die one size, from a $d4$ to a $d6$, from a $d6$ to a $d8$, or a $d8$ to a $d10$. If you do, you receive this upgrade immediately. You may only receive this upgrade $10$ times. |

| Ability Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may use your upgrade to gain an additional Ability. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. You may only receive this upgrade $2$ times. |

| History Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may upgrade the scope of your History Stat based on the events of the session by making two changes, two additions, or one of each to the scope of that Stat. This scope may not have more than seven narrative touchstones listed. If you choose this upgrade, you receive this upgrade immediately. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Carefree Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Carefree, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Blossomed, Prodigious, or Crafty. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Eager Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Eager, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Driven, Chosen, or Wired. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Wisened Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Wisened, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Steadfast, Warry, or Compelling. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Lost Upgrade |
| --- |
| Regardless of your starting Lifestyle, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Lost. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. Then, once your Lifestyle is Lost, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to any other option. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Free Adjustments |
| --- |
| Whenever you receive the Stat Upgrade, you may, as a free adjustment, downgrade one of your Stat Dice one size and upgrade a different Stat Die one size instead. Whenever you receive the Ability Upgrade, you may, as a free adjustment, lose one non-extended Ability and replace it with another. And whenever you upgrade or downgrade the size of your History Stat Die, you may receive the History Upgrade for free, limited to only one change or addition to the scope of your History Stat. |

| Item Upgrade |
| ------------ |
| You may upgrade one of your mundane items to a higher quality, within reason, so that it provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect. If you do, you receive this upgrade immediately. |

### GM Guide: Catching Players Up
<!-- _class: guide -->

Offer players one additional free upgrade at the end of sessions when they would have fewer total upgrades than the player with the most total upgrades.

<!-- _class: center major -->

## Dice
<!-- _class: center -->

> *There are two special rules to know about dice in this game: dice "bump," meaning they are rerolled when they roll a $1$, and some dice are "capped," meaning if they would roll a number higher than their cap, they roll the cap instead.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Bumping Dice

Dice in this game ‚Äúbump.‚Äù

When you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Succeeding on a Check or winning a Contest without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination and focus on the action.

Also note, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Capped Dice

Some rules in this game refer to "capped" dice&mdash;those related to Helping and Monstrosities. These dice are the standard dice of the game ($d4$ through $d10$), but "capped" at smaller values.

For example, the notation $dc2$ represents a $d4$ that has been capped at the value $2$: If the die were to roll a value greater than $2$, it rolls a $2$ instead. Put another way, this represents a single die with four sides, $1$, $2$, $2$, and $2$. This is the smallest possible capped die, as well as the most commonly used.

In general, the notation $dcX$ represents the smallest standard die in this game capable of rolling $X$, capped so that it cannot roll higher than $X$. In this notation, $dc4$ just is a $d4$, and so on. And as a special case, the notation $dc1$ is simply a die that always rolls $1$ and cannot bump.

### GM Guide: Bumping Die Statistics
<!-- _class: guide -->

If you need to estimate the average result of a roll of a die that bumps, follow this process.

Let $a$ be the average value of the die if it *doesn't* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means the average when not rolling a $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $b$ be the average value of the die if it *does* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means just the value $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $c$ be the number of values on the die that *don't* cause it to bump. Normally this means one less than the size of the die, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $k$ be the number of values on the die that *do* cause it to bump. Normally this means just $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Then, the average value of rolling the die would be:

$a + \frac{bk}{c}$

For example:

- the average of a $dc2$ is $2 + \frac{1}{3}$
- the average of a $d8$ with the Advanced Training Ability is $5 + \frac{2}{7}$

### Your Dice

You play this game with three sets of dice:

- Your Stat Dice, representing your general capabilities. You will likely need $2d4$, $2d6$, $2d8$, and $2d10$ over the course of the game.
- Your pool of Blessing Dice, which are spent to activate different Abilities. Your GM will likely provide this, either as a pool of several small $d6$ or as a deck of cards only containing several copies of the numbers $1$ through $6$.
- Any special dice used within the rules of your Abilities, if any. You may use your same Stat Dice, or carry a few extra dice as used by your Abilities. Most common is a $dc2$, so a few extra $d4$ will likely do the trick.

### Blessing Dice

Characters in this game each have a pool of Blessing Dice, representing a pool of resources they can draw upon to recharge their abilities and help their friends.

The GM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements.

When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice. And, like your Stat Dice, your Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way.

When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.

If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

### Spending Blessing Dice

Some actions can only be performed by first "spending" some number of dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth some value or more.

The notation ‚ë† represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $1$ or more. The notation ‚ë° represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $2$ or more. And so on.

The notation ‚ë†‚ë† represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. The notation ‚ë°‚ë° represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth $2$ or more. And so on.

When a Blessing Die is spent, it is removed from your pool of Blessing Dice.

### GM Guide: When to Award Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: guide -->

You should award players Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters' abilities depend on them.

What this looks like can vary per GM, per table, or per scene.

Some GMs may prefer an approach where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer an approach where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a GM in this game! Use it well!

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

All this being said, we recommend new GMs to this game use the following:

- Award $3$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such as after the player has introduced their character.
- Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions.
- Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story.
- Award a Blessing Die the first time each session the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $6$ or more, and award each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high win or success a Blessing Dice as well.
- Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session, before modifications to the roll from effects or Abilities. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both dice this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is almost impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game; such sessions take place narratively on an "unlucky day."

## Checks and Contests
<!-- _class: center -->

> *An "action" is anything you choose for your character to do. Some actions require you to perform rolls to determine the outcome. The simplest of these are Checks and Contests. The rules for more complex types of actions build up from there.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Basic Checks

To perform a Basic Check, roll the die for the action's associated Stat. The GM will let you know which to use. If the result of the roll meets or beats the GM's target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

### GM Guide: Setting Check Targets
<!-- _class: guide -->

In the table below, Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $1$ to $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.

| Difficulty | Target | Corresponding Outcome Size |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Lowest Possible | $3$ | Very Minor |
| Easy | $4$ | Minor |
| Medium | $8$ | Medium |
| Hard | $12$ | Major |
| Very Hard | $16$ | Very Major |
| Trial | $20$ | Maximum |

### GM Guide: Setting Targets for Magic
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your setting has "magic" or other supernatural, reality-bending player capabilities, the way you set targets for these Checks depends on the nature of "magic" in your setting. 

We recommend providing your players a table that describes your "magic" targets for them:

- Each row of the table corresponds to an outcome size, from Very Minor to Maximum.
- Each column corresponds to a "school of magic" or category of supernatural effect.
- Each cell describes examples of what a supernatural action of that outcome size and category might look like.
- Players and you determine which cells are most like what the player wants to achieve with their effect, and the highest outcome size among those cells is the outcome size their roll will need to meet, with you having final say on the exact Check target.
- Increase the outcome size they need to hit if they are pushing the area, duration, or nature of the effect further than normal; if they are untrained in the effect or it is outside their "school of magic"; or if the effect requires forbidden knowledge.
- Performing supernatural effects requiring beyond a Maximum outcome size requires a "quest" to do so.

### Automatic History Check Success

At GM discretion, you may automatically succeed History Checks if the scope of your History Stat is relevant enough to the Check and your History Stat Die is high enough, according to the table below.

| History Stat Die | Maximum Check target for automatic success |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $d4$  | $4$  |
| $d6$  | $8$ |
| $d8$  | $12$ |
| $d10$ | $16$ |

If you choose to automatically succeed this way, you succeed as though you had rolled exactly the Check's target, this roll cannot be modified by other effects, and the resulting outcome size (described later in this section) is reduced by one rank.

You may not choose to automatically succeed Checks this way while determining the Focal Action of Endeavors (described later in this chapter).

### Spark Checks

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

You may spend $2$ dice from your pool of Blessing Dice of the same worth to perform a Spark Check instead of a Basic Check, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each. These Spark Checks represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination&mdash;and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark Check also apply to the Spark Check itself.

You can decide to turn a Basic Check into a Spark Check before or after you've made your first roll for the Check.

For example, when you roll your first $1$ on the die, you can decide to take extra advantage of this opportunity. If you do, pay the Blessing Die cost to Spark, roll your second die, then reroll both for the bump, and add it all together.

### GM Guide: Spark Statistics
<!-- _class: guide -->

*This note continues from the previous statistics note.*

The equation for finding the average of a Sparked roll is similar to before, but finding the values to plug in takes a few extra steps.

Let $d$ be the size of the dice used for the Sparked roll.

Let $n$ be the number of dice used for the Sparked roll. Normally this is just $2$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $a_s$ be the average value of the dice if *none* of them rolls a value that would bump: $a_s = n a$.

Let $b_s$ be the average value of the dice if *any* of them rolls a value that would bump: $b_s = b + a \frac{c}{d} + b \frac{k}{d}$

Let $k_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *any* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $k_s = k^n + n (d-k) k^{n-1}$

Let $c_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *none* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $c_s = d^n - k_s$

Then, the average value of rolling the Sparked dice would be:

$a_s + \frac{b_s k_s}{c_s}$

### Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character's will using any Stat besides Hurt.

To perform a non-violent Contest:

1. The Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Check.
2. The Defender rolls as though performing a Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. If the Attacker uses a Spark Check, then the Defender may roll a Spark Check using either or both of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark Check, so long as the Defender pays the Blessing Die cost.
3. The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The size of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores.

---

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character's will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest:

1. The Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Check or Spark Check that involves Hurt.
2. The Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Check or Spark Check that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene.
3. The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The extent of the injury is determined by the difference between their scores, regardless if that was what the Attacker intended.
4. If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor.
5. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these continued attacks with a greater range of options than just Hurry, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

---

Also note, Checks use the terms "fail" and "succeed," while Contests use ‚Äúlose‚Äù and ‚Äúwin‚Äù instead.

When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks.

A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another.

For example, the "Bless√®d Luck" Ability allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win.

The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Size of Outcomes

In general, rolling higher leads to better outcomes.

Some rules refer to the "size" of an outcome, from Very Minor to Maximum, as determined by the table below.

| Outcome size | Succeed a Check by rolling at most... | Win a Contest by rolling at most...more than opponent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Minor | 3 | 1 |
| Minor | 7 | 3 |
| Medium | 11 | 5 |
| Major | 15 | 7 |
| Very Major | 19 | 9 |
| Maximum | 20 or more | 10 or more |

### GM Guide: Effect of Contest Outcomes
<!-- _class: guide -->

| Outcome size | Contest effect |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Very Minor or Minor | Attacker gets what they want, with complications, and the advantage is momentary. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain an Ache. |
| Medium | Attacker gets what they want, without complications, and the advantage lasts several rolls or shifts the narrative of the scene. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain an Ache or Pain. |
| Major or Very Major | Attacker gets what they want, and the ramifications may be serious though not life-threathening, shifting the narrative arc of the session or several sessions. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain a Weakness or Vulnerability. |
| Maximum | Attacker has likely gone too far for what they intended. Effects are serious, possibly needing immediate attention or miracle, shifting the narrative arc of several sessions or the campaign. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain multiple Weaknesses or Vulnerabilities |

### GM Guide: Describing Violent Effects
<!-- _class: guide -->

When describing the results of violent effects dealt to or by the player characters, don't only rely on status conditions or descriptions of injuries.

Include variety over the course of the campaign: What does the Attacker *want*? The character's motivations should drive the narrative, not just the game mechanics.

You can treat Minor and Medium violent effects as ways the Attacker can get at what they want from the Defender in the scene, which is not always to just inflict injury on others.

And you can treat Major violent effects as representing going too far using violent means to get what one wants.

When a character suffers a Major violent effect, it can be unsatisfying for them to be immediately incapacitated or, in the extreme, removed from the game.

Instead, you might draw the tension and possibility to respond out further. One way to do so is to provide the affected character's allies opportunity to perform a Home Contest against the same roll that the Attacker used to inflict the Major violent effect.

If an ally wins the Contest by $4$ or more, then the violent effect is successfully mitigated, perhaps reducing it to a Medium or Minor effect. However, if the Attacker is able to roll $8$ or more on a Hurt Check before the allies can successfully treat the effect, then the Attacker may deliver a *coup de grace*.

## Complex Actions, Helping, and Shopping
<!-- _class: center -->

> *There are special rules or considerations for when characters perform complex actions, work together as a group, and give and receive Help.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Long Actions

A long action is any action that is multi-step, spans a longer period of time than most other actions, and involves the scope of multiple Stats.

For example:

- Formulating a plan for a heist
- Engaging in political intrigue
- Crafting or reparing specialized items
- Navigating and piloting a crewed vessel
- Running a business
- Searching ruins for forbidden knowledge while avoiding bounty hunters' detection

There are two approaches the GM may take to resolving long actions:

- **Simple:** The GM may ask for a single Check or Contest, using only the single Stat that the long action's success or victory most turns on. The target for success or victory without difficulties or complications may be higher than usual in this case.
- **Thorough:** The GM may ask for multiple Checks or Contests using the various Stats involved in the long action. For overall success or victory, at least half of these rolls will need to win or succeed. However, each failure or loss may incur difficulties or complications on top of that success.

### Complex Attacks

Sometimes a character's attack in a Contest is itself a complex action requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

In such cases, the GM may set a target the Attacker needs to beat. The attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the GM's target.

When the Defender rolls, if the Defender rolls lower than the GM's target, the Contest is resolved as though the Defender had rolled that target instead.

This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to meet the target.

### Group Checks and Contests

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group. There are two general approaches:

- **Provide Help:** One way is to provide Help to one roll that leads the group's action, as described later in this section. Some members of the group may decide not to roll and instead wait for the group leader to roll, then provide Help to the leader by spending Blessings to increase the result of the roll.
- **Median Roll:** Another way is for each character to roll for the action, using the median of their rolls as the group's shared result. If the group roll had an even number of individual rolls, then the higher of the two median rolls is used. The table below provides a quick reference.

| Rolls made | Roll used |
| ---------- | --------- |
| $2$ | Highest |
| $3$ | Second highest |
| $4$ | Second highest |
| $5$ | Third highest |
| $6$ | Third highest |
| $7$ | Fourth highest |

---

These two approaches may even be combined, with some members rolling and taking their median, and the other members providing Help on top of that median. However, a group member cannot both roll and Help for the same action.

In general, once characters become a group as part of a Check or Contest, they remain a group until the end of the Check or Contest and are treated as a single character for the sake of the rules, sharing benefits and risks.

Also note, a character cannot force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

### Helping

All characters may can spend their Blessing Dice to Help one another complete Checks and Contests. And your Abilities, events, and items in the story may also Help you in similar ways.

Up to once per roll, whether your own or another character's, you may Help by spending a number of Blessing Dice, then that character rolls a capped die and adds the result to their roll. The more Blessing Dice spent this way, the larger the capped die rolled, according to the table below. You may only Help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action and your character is not currently engaged in another action.

| Blessing Dice Spent | Bonus Added |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| ‚ë† | $+1$ |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | $+dc2$ |
| ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† | $+dc3$ |
| ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† | $+dc4$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 5$ | $+dc5$ |
| $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 10$ | $+dc10$ |

---

Note, it is more cost effective, for example, for two characters to each spend ‚ë†‚ë† and both of them Help on an action than for one character to spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† and do all the Helping by themself!

This is because the Blessing Dice spent to Help yield diminishing returns: each additional Blessing Die spent this way, on average, provides a smaller bonus than the previous one.

### Receiving Situational Aid

While you and your allies can spend Blessings to Help one another, in certain situations your Abilities, items, environment, careful planning, or so on can provide you additional "Help" as well--and for free!

These effects describe a possible failed Check or lost Contest and say to receive $+X$ in aid in response. When you do, you gain a $+X$ bonus to the roll, as though you were Helped by the situation, possibly turning the failure into a success or loss into a win.

You can only receive situational aid once per roll. If multiple effects would provide situational aid during the same roll, you choose which one to use.

### Coming Prepared

You may perform a Home Check to see if you already came prepared with just the item you need.

The target you will need to reach may depend on details such as:

- How common, niche, specialized, rare, or unique in the world the desired item is.
- How probable it would be to already have that item.
- How many items your character already has listed.

Also, when you fail a Check to see if you already came prepared with an item, you may be unable to perform these Checks again until the end of the scene or session. And if you fail by a large amount, you may drop or break other items in your possession while digging around in your bag, alert others to your location, or so on.

### Shopping

Performing Home Checks to shop, trade, or so on is similar to performing Home Checks to see if you already came prepared with an item.

The difference is that if you are shopping in a place where it would be reasonable to find the desired item, and if would be reasonable for you to have the money or goods to trade for that item, then you may receive situational Help on the Check.

### Crafting

Crafting new items from your surroundings, tools, and supplies is a long action. This is because crafting usually requires a number of tasks that span the scope of multiple Stats:

- Gathering high quality supplies (Home)
- Gaining knowledge of how to construct the desired object (Head)
- Gathering or constructing the necessary tools (Hand or Home)
- Constructing the desired object, which can involve multiple steps depending on the complexity (Hand)
- Improvising adjustments when tools or supplies break or when one's initial plans were imperfect (Heart)
- Meddling with the forces of the universe (Hex, Ham, Hologram, or so on, for settings that have a Stat for the "magic" of the world)

---

The target you will need to hit for this craft long action will depend on the intended "quality" or effect of your desired item:

| Item quality | Typical outcome size | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Mundane | Very Minor or Minor | Narrative function only |
| High-Quality Mundane | Medium | Provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect |
| Powered | Major or Very Major | Provides a "receive $+dc2$ in aid" effect |

Also note, crafted items may come with flaws, even if you succeed overall. How flaws are introduced depends on how the GM chooses to resolve the craft long action:

- **Simple:** The GM may provide two targets for you to hit. To succeed you will need to hit the lower target, but to succeed without flaws or limitations you will need to hit the higher target.
- **Thorough:** The GM may require you to make multiple Checks. To succeed at crafting you will need to succeed on at least half of the individual Checks, with each failed Check introducing the chance for a flaw or limitation.

### Making Plans

When you and your fellow players propose plans that could direct sessions or whole campaigns, the GM may ask for a set of rolls similar to a group long action.

Each roll in this group long action will correspond to a different necessary step of your group's plans. Then, based on the results, the GM may provide different amounts or types of information to set you off on your "quest," representing your group's capabilities at planning and preparation.

## Simultaneous Actions and Endeavors
<!-- _class: center -->

> *There are special rules for when several characters are working towards competing aims at the same time.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### The Camera Rule

To resolve complex situations where several actions are competing for control of the narrative, *Humanity, Blessed* follows The "Camera Rule," inspired by how complex scenes are handled in film and television.

The "Camera Rule" has three parts:

- A character cannot be a part of multiple Contests or Checks at the same time.
- When multiple characters attempt to perform actions that would require Checks or Contests at the same time, only one of these actions can drive the central narrative. This is the Focal Action.
- Other actions that were attempted at the same moment, the Side Actions, could still occur. However, they could also be interrupted, muddled by the chaos of the situation, abandoned by the character in response to the results of the Focal Action, or so on; such incomplete actions are not considered wins, losses, failures, or successes, they simply don't go all the way from idea to execution.

### Simultaneous Actions

When several characters want to complete conflicting actions, all at the same time as they compete towards their respective goals, this requires a round of simultaneous actions.

To resolve a round of simultaneous actions, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Focal Action:** All characters roll for their attempted actions, as though they were performing their desired Check or performing their desired Contest as the Attacker. Only the highest of these rolls continues through as the Focal Action, with the GM resolving ties.
2. **Resolve the Focal Action:** The Focal Action is then resolved. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they perform their rolls as Defenders for that Contest.
3. **Determine and Resolve any Side Actions:** Side Actions are then determined and resolved. Starting with those that rolled the lowest in step 1, if they have already been involved in another Check or Contest this round, regardless if it was by choice, they no longer have the opportunity to act this round. Otherwise, they decide: Do they continue with their original idea, adapt it to the new situation around them, follow a brand new idea, hold their action until during or after another character's action, or abandon acting altogether? If they choose to act, they then perform and resolve their desired Check or Contest. If this action involves other characters, those characters cannot have already been involved in another Check or Contest already this round. Then continue this process with those who rolled the next lowest in step 1.

---

4. **End:** Once all characters have either been involved in a Check, Contest, or chosen not to act, the round of simultaneous actions is resolved.

For example, if two characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attempt to attack. Then only the higher roll goes through as both an attack and the Focal Action&mdash;the lower roll has been interrupted, neither winning, losing, failing, or succeeding. Then the lower roller rolls as a Defender against the attack, narrating how they respond, and effects are determined as usual. And as there were only two characters in this exchange, there were no opportunities for Side Actions by other characters.

For another example, two groups are competing in a battle of the bands, the *Dropkicks* and the *Blast Offffs!*, while a groupie named Sam cheers for the *Dropkicks* from the stands. First, the two groups roll Headline (a special Stat for the setting) and the groupie rolls Heart, all narrating how they attempt to act. Then only the highest of these three rolls goes through as the Focal Action. Let's say it's the *Dropkicks*, and with their music they attempted to summon a dragon of pure music to attack the *Blast Offffs!*. So, the *Blast Offffs!* now roll as a Defender against that attack, and their original plan has been interrupted. Finally, as a Side Action, Sam can continue with their original plan of cheering from the stands, or they can adjust their strategy and choose a different roll in response to the outcome of the *Dropkicks*'s attack.

Also note, once characters become grouped together for a Check or Contest in a round of simultaneous actions, they remain grouped for the rest of the round.

### Endeavors

Endeavors are multiple rounds of simultaneous actions during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on. Many scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved may be asked to perform Checks to overcome hazards in the environment. Each round, the narrative primarily follows a single Focal Action, then resolves smaller Side Actions before resolving hazards.

---

To perform an Endeavor:

1. **Setup:** The GM places a token representing each character involved in the Endeavor on a number line, starting at position $0$. Then, the GM describes the winning and losing conditions of the Endeavor, such as being the first to reach at least space $20$ at the end of a round, to have moved the furthest at the end of $3$ rounds, to be the last one standing by avoiding environmental hazards, or so on or some combination of conditions.
2. **Focal Action Advantage Movement:** At the top of each round, determine the Focal Action. Characters may choose to sit out this phase of the Endeavor. Whoever rolled the highest moves forward on the number line a number of spaces equal to the result of their roll. This represents the advantage gained towards their objectives as their proposed course of action directs the narrative tension. If there is a tie for highest roll, then no one gains this advantage movement during this step, though the GM still resolves the tie to determine the Focal Action for the next step.

---

4. **Focal Action Movement:** Next, resolve the Focal Action. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they roll to defend against it. Then the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the size of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.
5. **Side Action Movements:** Then, determine and resolve Side Actions, starting with those who sat out at the start of the round, then those who rolled the lowest at the start of the round, with the GM resolving ties. For each of these Side Actions, the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the size of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.

| Outcome Size | Spaces Moved |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Very Minor | 1 |
| Minor | 2 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Major | 5 |
| Very Major | 8 |
| Maximum | 13 |

---

6. **Hazards:** At the end of the round, the GM may describe an environmental hazard that could affect all or some of the leading characters involved the Endeavor, asking them to perform a Check to avoid the effects.
7. **End:** Repeat rounds until the Endeavor has been won, lost, ends in a draw, or gets interrupted.

Also note:

- **Focal Action Always Gets the Advantage:** The advantage movement a character gets as a result of rolling the highest when determining the Focal Action is separate from the movement of resolving the Focal Action. They get their advantage movement whether or not the Focal Action goes on to fail, succeed, win, or lose.
- **Group Movement:** If a winning or succeeding side in any of the steps above is a group, then when they move forward an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.
- **Group up and Roll for Focus:** You cannot roll and provide Help at the same time, so don't rush to roll at the top of the round. If you and your allies would like to provide Help to one another, first decide how you will form groups. Then act as a group accordingly from there.

### GM Guide: Simplified Focal Action Rolls
<!-- _class: guide -->

You may decide to simplify the process of determining the Focal Action by limiting the types of Stats that are applicable each round. For example:

- The party is ambushed. Ambushers roll Hurt, and the ambushed roll Hurry. Characters cannot sit out this round.
- The party is playing a game of giant magic chess. Each round, characters must roll Head or sit out.
- Two bands and their groupies are competing in a battle of the bands. Band members must roll Headline (a custom Stat for the setting), and groupies must sit out.

Keep in mind how your players actually think about the Endeavor and what their goals are! Simplifying the Focal Action this way removes player autonomy, but it also (a) lowers the cognitive load of thinking up a narrative for one's actions and (b) creates rules around the Endeavor that can make it feel distinct from other Endeavors in the campaign.

### GM Guide: Simplified Endeavor Check Targets
<!-- _class: guide -->

Instead of determining a target for each Check in an Endeavor, for most Checks you may allow characters to automatically succeed, but then compare the size of their outcome to the effect they wanted to achieve. Based on that, award them a weaker or stronger or moreorless complete version of that intended effect.

This allows you to reserve setting targets for Checks where failure would be interesting or that would change the arc of the Endeavor.

If you use this approach, characters would be unable to activate "receive aid" Abilities for Checks. So, make it clear the start of the Endeavor if, for the sake of the Endeavor, such Abilities (a) always activate, even without explicit failure, or (b) never activate because of the dire pressure of the situation.

### GM Guide: Multiple Number Lines
<!-- _class: guide -->

In Endeavors covering a larger playing field where it would be narratively unsatisfying for characters in different regions of the field to affect one another, you can split the Endeavor into two, at most three, number lines.

Depending on the situation, characters may be able to change the number line they are on, may be able to only if they succeed a Check or pay a movement cost, or may be able to only if the situation allows.

Regardless, the Endeavor still only has one Focal Action per round. What changes is that characters are limited in who they can interact with based on which number line they are on.

### GM Guide: Large-Scale Endeavors
<!-- _class: guide -->

Resolving actions that occur on massive scales, such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster, requires shifting the scale of the narrative. This can be done in a similar way through one round of an Endeavor, before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them.

The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

## Conditions
<!-- _class: center -->

> *While most effects serve to shape the narrative of the game, your GM may find it appropriate to also apply conditions to characters when the situation calls for it.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Surprise Threat

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump and cannot be a Spark Check.

### Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may attempt a Check to remove this condition.

### GM Guide: Becoming Uncool
<!-- _class: guide -->

The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

So when you build the narrative around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Nor do you have any "defensive" Stats. When you're hit, you're hit.

In this game, wounds primarily serve to shape narrative arcs. The worse the wound, the longer lasting the impact and the greater lengths you may have to go to treat them.

However, some injuries you receive may affect specific Stats, and these effects may range in degree. The lowest degree injury conditions are "aches," and the worst are "vulnerabilities."

- **Ache:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. This condition lasts until the end of the scene. *For example, Headache, Handcramp, Heartache, and Homesick.*
- **Pain:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat are made with a $-1$ modifier. This condition lasts until you rest in a safe place. *For example, Migraine, Soreness, Sadness, and Robbery.*
- **Weakness:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat cannot receive Help, including Help from items, Abilities, or situations. This condition lasts until it is treated. *For example, Confusion, Exhaustion, Dejection, and Illness.*
- **Vulnerability:** When an opposing character witnesses you perform a roll using the affected Stat, they may have you perform the roll again and use the new value. This condition lasts until it is treated. *For example, Memory Loss, Numbness, Wretchedness, and Destitution.*

### Other Conditions

- **Agreeable to $X$:** Rolls you make as a Defender in non-violent Contests where $X$ is an Attacker that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. If $X$ does an action or makes a request that would bring you harm, this condition ends.
- **Famous:** You may exert your fame over a character who is less famous than you, gaining a $+dc2$ bonus in a Contest against them. You may not do so against the same character more than once during the same session or while you are Uncool.
- **Muddled:** The next roll you make when determining the Focal Action in an Endeavor is made with a $-2$ modifier. Then, this condition ends.
- **Cursed:** Dice in your pool of Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $0$. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Distracted:** Rolls you make do not bump. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Disarmed:** If you would win a violent Contest as the Attacker with a Maximum outcome, you win with a Very Major outcome instead. When you find a new weapon or take a moment to recompose yourself, this condition ends.
- **Taxed:** You cannot perform Spark Checks. Spending ‚ë†‚ë† ends this condition.

## Special Endeavors
<!-- _class: center -->

> *There are a number of special types of Endeavors in this game, which add additional obstacles, actions, restrictions, and win conditions to the basic rules for Endeavors described above. Work with your GM to know which to expect in your campaign.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### üõ°Ô∏è Clash Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters summoning, rallying, or inspiring allies to face off against an opposing side's summoned, rallied, or inspired allies&mdash;such as soldiers in your command, athletes you are coaching, creature companions you have befriended, knights dueling as your champions, spirits you are channeling, or spectral monsters you've summoned by playing music so well!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Summons:** For the sake of these rule additions, a "summon" is a character or other entity you have summoned to your side for the Endeavor, and a "summoner" is any character or group summoning others to their side. A summon is a character for the sake of wording in the rules, and they act in the Endeavor on their own, performing Check and Contest rolls as usual. And generally, a summon is considered to exist before they have been summoned to your side&mdash;"being summoned" just places them into the game's evolving story.
- **Summons Capture:** When a summon wins a Contest against an opposing summon in a Contest, they may attempt to capture that opposing summon. And when a summon gains advantage movement, they may attempt to capture any summon.

---

- **Attempting Capture:** When a summon attempts to capture an opposing summon, they move backward on the number line any amount. Then, that opposing summon performs a Check where the target is equal to the number of spaces moved backward. If they fail, they are non-lethally removed from the Endeavor. Then regardless of the Check's result, the current round immediately ends.
- **Summoners Summon but Don't Move:**  Summoners do not have a position on the number line, but they still act in the Endeavor, performing Check and Contest rolls as usual. If a summoner would gain advantage movement, they instead add another summon aiding them to the number line at position $0$. The more advantage movement a summoner would have gained, the more powerful the summon added. Any other movement a summoner would gain, such as from resolving Focal or Side Actions, they choose a summon aiding them to gain that movement instead.
- **Initial Summons:** Each summoner begins the Endeavor with two summons aiding them at position $0$ on the number line. Moreover, if a summoner goes an entire round without a summon aiding them on the number line, they add one at position $0$ at the end of the round.
- **End Condition:** The end condition for the Endeavor depends on the scene in question. However, generally a summoner wins a Clash Endeavor when one of their summons reaches at least a predetermined point on the number line, or when their summons have captured at least a predetermined number of opposing summons.

### GM Guide: Stats for Summons
<!-- _class: guide -->

For simplicity, Summons may use Stats similar to how Monstrosities use them. You may use the following table as a starting point for converting advantage movement gained to summon Stats.

| Advantage movement | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| $3$ or less | Summon fails. |
| $4$ to $7$ | Summon uses $dc2$ for Stats. |
| $8$ to $11$ | Summon uses $dc4$ for Stats. |
| $12$ to $15$ | Summon uses $dc6$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $dc4$ and has an extra Ability. |
| $16$ to $19$ | Summon uses $dc8$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $dc6$ and has an extra Ability. |
| $20$ or more | Summon uses $dc10$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $dc8$ and has an extra Ability. Or, summon uses $dc6$ and has two extra Abilities. |

You may also allow your players to determine their "pool" of summons ahead of time through roleplay, if it makes sense for the campaign setting.

In any case, getting summons their Stats and onto the number line should be a *quick* process.

### üîé Discovery Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters explore a mansion for clues, search through the rubble of a crashed spaceship, delve into a dungeon, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, or added into any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Lay of the Land:** At the top of the first round, the GM will provide the lay of the land of the environment the characters are exploring, such as what rooms are available and how they relate. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own number line and lay of the land. 
- **Glimmer Buttons:** When the GM gives a lay of the land, a number of "glimmer buttons" are added throughout the number line. When the movement of a character moves over one of these points on the number line, that character can attempt to interact with that glimmer button. If a character would activate multiple glimmer buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate.

---

- **Interacting with Glimmer Buttons:** To interact with a glimmer button and gain the discovery associated with it, a character must succeed a Check. The target for this Check is equal to the glimmer button's position on the number line. If the character's most recent roll in the Endeavor would have met this target, then the character automatically succeeds this Check. This Check is considered an extension to the character's current course of action and does not provide additional movement toward the Endeavor. When this Check is succeeded, the glimmer button is removed from the number line. It may also be removed when the Check is failed, at GM's discretion.
- **Types of Glimmer Buttons:** The GM may add multiple types of glimmer buttons to the number line, representing different types of discoveries for the area, such as items, information, social interactions, or further areas to explore.

### GM Guide: Preparing Glimmer Buttons
<!-- _class: guide -->

You do not need to specify ahead of time which discoveries correspond to each glimmer button. Instead, decide which categories of discoveries might be present in the area: items, information, social interactions, traps, or so on.

Then, for each, decide how copious it might be in the area:

- **Rare:** Roll $1d4-2$ and if the result is positive add that many glimmer buttons of that type to the number line. This die bumps as usual. (For even rarer discoveries, you can roll $1d4-3$ or $1d4-4$ instead.)
- **Uncommon:** Do the same as above, but with $1d4$.
- **Common:** Do the same as above, but with $1d6$.
- **Abundant:** Do the same as above, but with $1d8$.
- **Copious:** Do the same as above, but with $1d10$.

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

Then, improvise following your players' choices. For example, when they decide to interact with a "loot" glimmer at position $10$ instead of a "social" glimmer, ask yourself:

- What are they looking for?
- What Stat did they use to reach it?
- What would a "loot" of target $10$ look like?
- What might be available in this area?
- How does this area relate to the larger area and events of the story?
- What information can you present alongside it?
- What item, result, or information could be given for free based on the character's History scope?
- If the character will need to roll a new Check to interact with the glimmer, what Stat can you ask them to roll that will add new detail to the scene without being the same Stat they just rolled?

### üßü Monstrous Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Muddle Buttons:** When each Monstrosity joins the Endeavor, it adds one or more "muddle buttons" to the number line. When the movement of a player character or one of their allies moves over one of these points on the number line, that Monstrosity is Muddled for the next round, representing a momentary crack in the Monstrosity's defenses&mdash;literally or figuratively. Then, the button is removed. If a player character or one of their allies would activate multiple muddle buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate. Be warned though, as some Monstrosities have Abilities that grow in power the more times they've been muddled this way!
- **Stamina:** Each Monstrosity has an amount of "stamina." At the end of each round, if the player characters and their allies have a combined value on the number line equal to or greater than a Monstrosity's stamina, those characters may move backwards on the number line a total amount equal to the Monstrosity's stamina. If they do, they non-lethally remove that Monstrosity from the Endeavor and narrate what happens.

### GM Guide: Monstrous Stats
<!-- _class: guide -->

Instead of a number of Stat Dice, a Monstrosity typically has a single die shared by all their Stats. And to allow a finer gradient of "weak" to "strong" Monstrosities, their Stat Dice is a capped die, from $dc2$ to $dc10$.

The die cap $dc10$ is the strongest die cap a Monstrosity can have, and the player characters will, in just a few sessions, catch up to this point.

For higher level Endeavors, you may give your Monstrosities Abilities, choosing from the following or creating your own.

Additionally, you may have your Monstrosities enter Endeavors with a number of Blessings.

### GM Guide: Monstrous Abilities
<!-- _class: guide -->

All Monstrosities have the Capture Ability.

| Capture |
| --- |
| When you gain advantage movement, you may move backward on the number line any amount. If you do, choose an opponent. That opponent then performs a Check where the target is equal to the number of spaces you moved backward. If they fail, you non-lethally remove that opponent from the Endeavor and advance toward your objectives. Then regardless of the Check's result, the current round immediately ends. At the end of subsequent rounds, that opponent may attempt this Check again to re-enter the Endeavor. |

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

You may also give your Monstrosities any of the following Monstrous Abilities or create your own. These Abilities are listed in a rough order from "weakest" to "strongest."

It is also recommended that you do not give your Monstrosities many Abilities&mdash;one or two well-placed Abilities are plenty to make a Monstrosity memorable! Consider adding multiple Monstrosities to a Monstrous Endeavor that have complementary skills to create sessions that feel engaging and strategic. And for Monstrosities that use "magic" or wield some other kind of powerful force, we recommend using the Spark Rush $X$ Ability, flavoring it for the occasion.

| Resistance vs. $X$ |
| --- |
| Whenever you would lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, receive $+dc2$ in aid. |

| Revenge |
| --- |
| When you become Muddled, you may immediately perform a Contest as an Attacker against the character that Muddled you, as though this Contest were a Side Action, even if you or the Defender have already acted this round. |

| Shield vs. $X$ |
| --- |
| When you succeed a Home Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Resistance vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it. |

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

| Flatten |
| --- |
| When you succeed a Hand Contest against an opponent during an Endeavor, you may have that opponent move backwards a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. |

| Debilitate $X$ |
| --- |
| Perform a $X$ Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, that opponent's $X$ rolls are made with a $-1$ modifier for that many rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it. |

| Propel |
| --- |
| When determining the Focal Action, you may exchange the result of your own roll with that of an ally who rolled lower than you. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it. |

| Clarity |
| --- |
| When you succeed a Home Check during an Endeavor, you may have the muddle buttons of your allies move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. |

| Immunity vs. $X$ |
| --- |
| Whenever you would lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, you instead succeed by $1$. |

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

| Inspire |
| --- |
| When you succeed a Hurry Check during an Endeavor, you may choose an ally and have the roll they make to determine the Focal Action next round increase by $+3$ or by a number equal to the amount you moved forward as a result of the Check, whichever is lower. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it. |

| Curse |
| --- |
| Perform a Head Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, the opponent is Cursed by you for that many rounds. (When you see that opponent perform a roll, you may choose to have them reroll it and take the new value, then the Curse ends. Otherwise, the Curse ends when that many rounds have passed.)  Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. |

| Mirror vs. $X$ |
| --- |
| When you succeed a Home Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Immunity vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë• to recharge it. |

| Spark Rush $X$ |
| --- |
| Perform a Check. The amount you move forward as a result of this Check, for that many rounds, to a maximum of $3$ rounds, you may Spark using $2dcX$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ìç to recharge it. |

| Merciless |
| --- |
| At the end of each round, gain a number of Blessings equal to the number of times you've been Muddled. |

### GM Guide: Balanced Monstrosities
<!-- _class: guide -->

As another starting point, the following relationships between the parts of a Monstrosity's build tend to produce balanced, mechanically familiar builds:

- Die caps ($C$) range from $2$ to $10$, with die caps maxing out around the 33% mark of a campaign.
- The number of Blessings ($B$) a Monstrosity starts Endeavors with range from $0$ to $20$, with "everyday" Monstrosities starting to get Blessings around the 33% mark of a campaign, and maxing out toward the end of the campaign. For Monstrosities that have a "squad leader" feel earlier in the campaign, give them $1$ or $2$ Blessings.
- Stamina ($S$) is typically $5 \times C$, but ranging from roughly $3 \times C$ to $8 \times C$. Stamina around the low end of this range gives a "squishier" feel to the Monstrosity, and Stamina around the high end gives a "tankier" feel. For Monstrosities with an "arc boss" feel, give them closer to $5 \times (B+C)$.
- Almost all Monstrosities have only a single muddle button, placed on the number line at a point ranging from around $S/5$ to $S/2$. Muddle button positions around the low end of this range give an "unprotected" feel, and positions around the high end give an "armored" feel. Also, pairing a low muddle button position with the Revenge ability gives a "hair trigger" feel.
- For Monstrosities with an "arc boss" feel, give them multiple evenly spaced muddle buttons, paired with Unrelenting or Merciless.

### GM Guide: Spoils
<!-- _class: guide -->

Like any other important moment in the narrative, you may choose to award your players Blessings for progressing through a milestone or for creative or cooperative gameplay during the Monstrous Endeavor. 

Additionally, at the end of a Monstrous Endeavor, you may permit your players to perform Checks to find items of interest along the "spoils" of their victory. For example, players may look for parts they can reuse when they defeat murderous robots, a clue revealing the location of the mad scientist's hideout when they calm and befriend one of her creations, or so on.

These narratively reflective moments after a Monstrous Endeavor can be a great chance to rebalance the narrative tension while giving your players agency in thinking about where the story goes next.

### GM Guide: Experience Points
<!-- _class: guide -->

You do not need to use experience points (XP) in your campaign, but if you do, we recommend the following:

- A Monstrosity's XP ranges according to the following table.
- Total the XP for all Monstrosities in the Endeavor to get the Endeavor's XP.
- Track the Endeavor XP high score the party has achieved. This is instead of tracking the total of all XP ever gained, as is common in many combat-based RPGs.
- When the party gains a new Endeavor XP high score, award them a total prize relative to the *increase* in that high score from its previous value. For example, when the party increases their high score from $3$ to $6$, you might award them $3$ Blessings divided among them.

This approach allows you to represent larger spoils consistently for larger-feeling Endeavors, while not outpacing the game's linear progression system (the Session Shop).

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

| XP | Description |
| -- | ----------- |
| $(B + C)/2$ | Monstrosity feels underpowered for the current tier of play |
| $B + C$ | Monstrosity feels about right for a typical foe at this tier of play |
| $2 \times (B + C)$ | Monstrosity feels a little more powered than its peers, such as having a higher Muddle button or more Abilities than the typical foe at that tier of play |
| $3 \times (B + C)$ | A surprising strong foe for this tier of play, a trial to be overcome but not an arc boss |
| $4 \times (B + C)$ | An arc boss |
| $5 \times (B + C)$ | Endgame |

### üèá Race Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters race against one another or their opponents, whether it be on foot, on horseback, in sleds, in cars, or even in spaceships!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Endurance Checks:** At the end of each round, if a character spent Blessings that round, they must succeed a Check to remain in the race, representing the character's endurance to keep racing after a hard push. The target for this Check is equal to the total number of Blessings the character has spent this Endeavor.
- **Terrain Buttons:** At the top of the first round, the GM will describe the shape of the race course, adding a number of "terrain buttons" to the number line to represent hills, brush, holes, asteroid fields, or so on that slow the racers down. The first time a character would move past a terrain button's position on the number line, they instead end their movement for the round on the same space as the button.
- **Escape Bonus:** If a character gains advantage movement as a result of rolling the highest when determining the Focal Action, and they began that movement on the same space as a terrain button, they gain two bonuses to their advantage movement. First, they move forward on the number line an additional $+2$. And second, they may ignore up to one terrain button they would move past during this movement.

---

- **Types of Terrain Buttons:** The GM may add multiple types of terrain buttons to the number line, representing different types of terrain obstacles for the area, such as hills, stampedes, quantum puzzles, or trolley problem moral dilemmas. When a character begins the round on a terrain button, the type of the terrain button may constrain what Stats they may roll or what actions they may take.

### üí£ Stealth Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Alarm Buttons:** At the start of the Endeavor, the GM adds a number of "alarm buttons" throughout the number line. If a character ends its first movement of the round on the same space as an alarm button, then the character is "made" by the watchful eye they are trying to avoid. What happens when a character is made this way depends on the Encounter. For example, the party immediately loses when any character is made. Or after a number of times being made, the Endeavor changes. Or when a character is made, they perform a Check whose target is equal to the button's position on the number line, and the character is removed from the Endeavor if they fail that Check. Or so on.
- **Alarm Buttons Move:** At the end of each round, the alarm buttons move, according to some set pattern only the GM knows. Nothing happens immediately when an alarm button ends its movement in the same space as a character. However, if a character chooses to sit out of acting at the top of a round while sharing a space with an alarm button, then the chatacter is made just as though they had moved onto it.

---

- **Failed Checks Increase Alertness:** Whenever a character fails a Check or loses a Contest while resolving a Focal Action or Side Action, the "alertness" of the Endeavor increases, represented by an additional alarm button being added to the number line.
- **Negative Help:** Whenever a character receives Help, they may choose to subtract the bonus from their roll instead of adding it as usual.

# Quick Reference
<!-- _class: center major quick -->

### Endeavors
<!-- _class: quick -->

1. **Focal Action Advantage Movement:** Highest roller moves equal to their roll. Reminder: Declare if you are grouping with others or Helping before you roll; if you Help you don't roll.
2. **Other Movements:** Resolve all actions one at a time. First the highest roller above, then lowest, second-lowest, and so on. Succeed a Check or win a Contest to move according to Endeavor Movement Table. If someone else attacks you before you can act, your action is interrupted. You cannot attack someone who has already acted or already been attacked.
