## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

# Making Your First Character
<!-- _class: center major creation -->

## Stats
<!-- _class: center creation -->

> *Each character in this game has a small number of Stats. Together, these represent a character's general capabilities at a wide range of tasks and situations.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Character Creation: Step One!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe the **Stats** used in *Humanity, Blessed*, known collectively as **the H's of Humanity**. Your GM may add an additional one as well.

Your first task is to decide **which Stat your character is best at**.

As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. **Why are they good at this and not at that?** Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

When you begin the game, most of your Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Checks. However, the Stat you chose as your **highest Stat begins the game one die size larger**. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Stat Dice.

All of your Stat Dice may be **upgraded later in the Session Shop** section at the end of this chapter.

### Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

All characters in this game have the following Stats, each related to a different "scope" of action:

| üß† Head Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music, picking locks. |
| With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. |
| With a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach. |

| ‚úåÔ∏è Hand Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Athletic pursuits, endurance, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly, pickpocketing. |
| With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. |
| With a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üíï Heart Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally, creating expressive art, performing sleights of hand for an audience. |
| With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. |
| With a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are. |

| ‚òï Home Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Protecting yourself and loved ones, tending to illness and wounds, shopping, crafting, scavenging, camping, cooking, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. |
| With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. |

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëø Hurt Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. |
| With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. |
| With a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies. |

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. |
| With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. |
| With a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like. |

| ‚è≥ History Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, and hardships covered by your Focus, as well as other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people but not covered by your other Stats. |
| With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialized training you set out to achieve. |
| With a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often. |

### Optional Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

Your GM may add one of the following Stats to your game, depending on the game's setting and tone:

| ü™∂ Hex Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. |
| *For a magic or fantasy setting.* |

| ü•ï Ham Stat |

| Scope: Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. |
| *For a cartoon setting.* |

| üîé Hunch Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. |
| *For a film noir setting.* |

| ü¶æ Hardware Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. |
| *For a cyberpunk setting.* |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üëæ Hologram Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. |
| *For a futuristic setting.* |

| üí∞ Hireling Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. |
| *For an absurd capitalist setting.* |

| üéÅ Holly Jolly Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. |
| *For a winter wonderland setting.* |

| üéß Headline Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. |
| *For a battle of the bands setting.* |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| ü¶† Host Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. |
| When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while using this Stat, receive $+d2$ in aid. There may be consequences. |
| *For an alien paranormal suspense setting.* |

| üíÄ Hardship Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Shared narrative touchstones of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. |
| This Stat cannot be only be a $d4$. |
| *For a suspense horror setting.* |

| üëª Haunted Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. |
| This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, and can only be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d2$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. This Stat's die bumps as normal. |
| *For a Poe style setting.* |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üå≥ Hardy Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Shared narrative touchstones emerging from each session's obstacles and players' combined efforts against the challenges they've faced. |
| This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d2$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy die instead of one of their other Stat Dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d2$. |
| *For a coming of age setting.* |

| ‚ö´ Haze Stat |
| --- |
| Scope: Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. |
| This die begins the game as a $d2$ and only changes when the character fails certain Checks or loses certain Contests against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat Die instead of their own usual die for the roll. |
| *For a psychological horror setting.* |

### Stat Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each of a character's Stats is represented by a Stat Die:

| Notation | Stat Die |
| -------- | -------- |
| $d10$ | A ten-sided die. The largest die size in the game. |
| $d8$  | An eight-sided die. |
| $d6$  | A six-sided die. |
| $d4$  | A four-sided die. |
| $d2$  | Any of the above dice, treating any odd number as $1$ and any even number as $2$. The smallest die size in the game. |

Stat Dice in this game also "bump."

This means that when you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again and add the new result to the previous result.

As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Success and victory without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination or focus on the action.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$.

When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Note, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$.

Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### GM Guide: Bumping Die Statistics
<!-- _class: guide -->

If you need to estimate the average result of a roll of a die that bumps, follow this process.

Let $a$ be the average value of the die if it *doesn't* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means the average when not rolling a $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $b$ be the average value of the die if it *does* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means just the value $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $c$ be the number of values on the die that *don't* cause it to bump. Normally this means one less than the size of the die, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $k$ be the number of values on the die that *do* cause it to bump. Normally this means just $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

Then, the average value of rolling the die would be:

$a + \frac{bk}{c}$

For example:

- the average of a $d2$ is $2 + \frac{1}{2}$
- the average of a $d8$ with the Advanced Training Ability is $5 + \frac{2}{7}$

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

The equation for finding the average of a roll with grouped dice is similar to before, but finding the values to plug in takes a few extra steps.

Let $d$ be the size of the dice used for the roll.

Let $n$ be the number of dice used for the roll. Normally this is just $2$, but some Abilities modify this.

Let $a_s$ be the average value of the dice if *none* of them rolls a value that would bump: $a_s = n a$.

Let $b_s$ be the average value of the dice if *any* of them rolls a value that would bump: $b_s = b + a \frac{c}{d} + b \frac{k}{d}$

Let $k_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *any* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $k_s = k^n + n (d-k) k^{n-1}$

Let $c_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *none* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $c_s = d^n - k_s$

Then, the average value of rolling the Sparked dice would be:

$a_s + \frac{b_s k_s}{c_s}$

## Lifestyle and Ethic
<!-- _class: center creation -->

> *Each character in this game has a Lifestyle and Ethic. These represent characters' general backgrounds, goals, and beliefs about the world, and these can change over the course of the story.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Character Creation: Step Two!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe **Lifestyle** and **Ethic** options. Some Lifestyles are **upgrade options** you will not have access to when the game begins.

As you read them, begin to describe the life your character had **growing up** and their **current outlook** on the world. You may also want to consult the **Playing the Game chapter** to learn more about the rules Lifestyles interact with.

Then, pick one of the **Lifestyles** with the **[Starter]** label and one of the **Ethics** to begin the game with. These can be changed later in the Session Shop.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

Once you've chosen your starter Lifestyle and Ethic, consult the table below. **Two of your Stats** begin the game an additional **die size larger**, according to your starter Lifestyle and Ethic:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <th scope="col">Virtue &amp; Vice</th>
        <th scope="col">Fate &amp; Knowledge</th>
        <th scope="col">Cunning &amp; Capability</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <th scope="row">Carefree</th> <td>Heart and Hurry</td> <td>Head and Hurt</td> <td>Hand and Home</td> </tr>

        <tr> <th scope="row">Wisened</th> <td>Head and Home</td> <td>Hand and Hurry</td> <td>Heart and Hurt</td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Lifestyles
<!-- _class: ability -->

| --- |
| You can envision amazing designs and, it seems, to bring them to life. When you Spark, it might take on an autonomous or lucky aspect. Overcharge your Hand and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by your own sudden creativity. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üî• Eager Lifestyle [Starter] | 
| --- |
| Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, a person you want to impress, or a mission or faith you believe strongly in. |

| ‚öúÔ∏è Driven Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| Your eager drive has found purchase in a great mission or calling. When you Spark, it might take on an incorrigible or resolute aspect. Overcharge your Hand and Hurt Stats, as though you were Helped by your own faith in your mission. |

| ‚ú® Chosen Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| You draw inspiration from the community around you, setting out on your journeys blessed, favored, or even cursed. When you Spark, it might take on a divine or noble aspect. Overcharge your Heart and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by the will of the people whose lives you've touched. |

| ‚ö° Wired Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| Your mind is quick and analytical, and you can see solutions to problems that are unimaginably complex. When you Spark, it might take on a calculating or duplicative aspect. Overcharge your Head and Hurry Stats, as though you were Helped by your own mind palace. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened Lifestyle [Starter] | 
| --- |
| Maybe life has not been easy on your character, but if so you've come out wiser and tougher. Perhaps you've been shaped by unfortunate events, you've dedicated yourself to your work, or (in some settings) you could take advantage of others easily because you understand how people work. |

| ü™¨ Steadfast Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| Your wise steadiness and alertness have made you adept at warding off harm and protecting your loved ones. When you Spark, it might take on a firm or dispelling aspect. Overcharge your Head and Home Stats, as though you were Helped by your care for others. |

| üëÅÔ∏è Warry Lifestyle |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üíé Lost Lifestyle |
| --- |

When you Spark, it might take on an erratic or liminal aspect. Overcharge your History Stat, as though you were Helped by your quest for self-discovery. |

### Ethics
<!-- _class: ability -->

| ‚öîÔ∏è Virtue &amp; Vice Ethic |
| --- |
| Deep down, you may believe that there is good in the world and that no matter how terrible the world gets, the people who are good will win in the end. You may also believe that people who live with virtue are able to live in harmony together, while excess vice manifests itself as a clear and knowable "darkness." |

| üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge Ethic |
| --- |
| What drives your actions may be a firm belief that your personal traits dictate your destiny, not whether you are "good," and that personal traits can never really be changed. You may also believe that your destiny can be altered to your liking by making the right deal, adhering to the right discipline, or acquiring the right knowledge‚Äîends justify the means after all. |

| ‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability Ethic |
| --- |
| At the end of the day, you may believe that the only person you can really trust is yourself. You may also believe that the world is unfair, "good" and "fate" are made up ideas, and you'd do whatever it takes to just get by. |

### GM Guide: Campaign Ethic
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you begin to imagine the world and genre of your campaign, consider what it means to be "Carefree," "Eager," or "Wisened" in your setting. Doing so requires making assumptions about the Ethic of the world itself!

**‚öîÔ∏è Virtue &amp; Vice** settings are well equipped for high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories. This is likely the most familiar genre for your players, especially for good vs. evil stories. The Blossomed, Driven, and Steadfast upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge** settings are well equipped for dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror. This genre resists feeling familiar, as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. The Prodigious, Chosen, and Warry upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

**‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability** settings are well equipped for cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories. This genre is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without necessarily a clear good vs. evil component. The Crafty, Wired, and Compelling upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings.

## Focus
<!-- _class: center creation -->

> *Each character has a unique Focus for their History Stat, made up of a number of narrative touchstones that describe their backstory.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Character Creation: Step Three!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe your character's backstory. **Answer the following prompts** or others given to you by your GM.

These background details will help you and your GM build the story and set the **Focus** of your **History Stat**.

- Describe **who your character looks up to**, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
- List **three specific skills** that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
- List **three specific people or groups** that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
- Describe **where your character could be found** on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
- If your game's setting has **non-human characters** and your character is one of them, work with your GM to determine how your non-human background affects your Focus or the scope of your Stats.

---
<!-- _class: creation -->

And as you play, **keep notes**! These can help you reflect on you and your group's shared "Group History," as well as your **character's relationship to the Group History**. Maybe not everyone in the party is enthused about the items the party stole last time!

Such reflection can help you **shape the course** of your Focus and your character's development over the duration of the story, **make important character choices** during your sessions, and **inspire you and your GM** for ideas for future scenes and sessions.

### GM Guide: Determining Focus
<!-- _class: guide -->

As you work with your players to develop their backstory and Focus, come up with a list of three to five specific narrative touchstones for each player that describe what their History Stat covers. For example:

- Tying Knots (for a scout)
- Swordfighting (for a knight)
- Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn)
- Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician)
- Acting (for a theater kid)
- Manipulating Technology (for a hacker)
- Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer)
- Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the empire)
- Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the empire)

Consider what *unique* skills, proficiencies, traits, and backstory elements each character brings to the story. Also consider the *variety* of a character's Focus: if all or most of them would be covered already by another Stat, then the player would have no reason to use or upgrade their History Stat!

### GM Guide: Non-Human Characters
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your game's setting allows your players to create non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent it. The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds between your players:

- **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's Focus to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their non-human background could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.
- **Low Variety:** If player characters all come from just a few non-human background options, then using their Focus to cover this background would clog them with details that aren't unique to each player. Instead, expand the scope of two or three Stats besides History to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.

## Abilities
<!-- _class: center creation -->

> *Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, Ethic, and History to flesh out their key defining traits!*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Character Creation: Step Four!
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe **Ability** options. As your read them, you may want to consult the **Playing the Game** chapter to learn more about the rules they interact with.

To help you select your starter Abilities, begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. **Have you seen characters like them before** in movies, TV shows, and books? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

Then with that in mind, **pick two** of the following Abilities with the **[Starter]** label to begin the game with. You may gain additional Abilities later in the Session Shop.

### Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Abilities and other effects cost "Blessing Dice" to activate.

To pay these costs, each character has a pool of Blessing Dice, representing resources they can draw upon when the moment calls.

The GM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements.

When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice.

And like your Stat Dice, Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way.

When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.

If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

When you spend a Blessing Die, remove it from your pool of Blessing Dice.

An effect may require you to spend a Blessing Die of at least a certain size. An effect may also require you to spend multiple Blessing Dice at the same time.

The following table provides a few examples of how Blessing Dice costs are notated in this game:

| Notation | Blessing Dice |
| -------- | ------------- |
| ‚ë• | A Blessing Die worth $6$. The largest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë° | A Blessing Die worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë† | A Blessing Die worth $1$ or more. The smallest Blessing Die in the game. |
| ‚ë°‚ë° | Two Blessing Dice each worth $2$ or more. |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | Two Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚ë† $\times 4$ | Four Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. |
| ‚äú‚äú | Two Blessing Dice of the same worth. |

### GM Guide: When to Award Blessing Dice
<!-- _class: guide -->

You should award players Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters' abilities depend on them.

What this looks like can vary per GM, per table, or per scene.

Some GMs may prefer an approach where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer an approach where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a GM in this game! Use it well!

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

All this being said, we recommend new GMs to this game use the following:

- Award $3$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such as after the player has introduced their character.
- Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions.
- Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story.
- Award a Blessing Die the first time each session the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $6$ or more, and award each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high win or success a Blessing Dice as well.
- Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session, before modifications to the roll from effects or Abilities. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both dice this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is almost impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game; such sessions take place narratively on an "unlucky day."

### Abilities
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Abilities **require** another Ability or condition. Such Abilities **cannot be gained until** you've first gained the required Ability or met the required condition.

Some Abilities **extend** another Ability. When you gain such an Ability, it **does not count against your number of Ability Upgrades** received. However, each Ability may only be extended once this way. If an Ability would extend an already extended Ability, it still does count against your total number of Abilities.

And some Abilities list a **recharge** cost. Once activated, these Abilities **cannot be activated again** until they have been recharged by paying that cost.

When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while working with your companion, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ depends on the companion and the Stat used, ranging from $-1$ to $+d4$. Moreover, this companion has its own backstory which extends your Focus while you work with it. If this companion is lost, stolen, destroyed, or you lose its loyalty, replacing it may require time and effort. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Intuitive Eye [Starter] |
| --- |
| You have a keen sense with objects and surroundings that most others don't. When you would fail a Check to inspect an object carefully, identify where the object has been, or intuit information about events that have occurred around it, receive $+d2$ in aid. |

Roguish, Divining, and Ambitious Eye each require and extend Intuitive Eye.

| Roguish Eye |
| --- |
| And this keeness has helped you narrowly escape trouble on multiple occasions. Once per Stealth Endeavor, when you would be made you may instead increase the alertness of the Endeavor. |

| Divining Eye |
| --- |
| And because of your deductive or intuitive skills, secrets have a hard time hiding from you. When you succeed a Check to decrypt an encoded or cryptic message, increase the size of the outcome by one rank. |

| Ambitious Eye |
| --- |
| And you don't mind using items up to achieve your goals. Once per session, you may destroy an object in your possession. Until the end of the scene, you adopt the properties of the object, the properties of a concept associated with the object, or push the item to its breaking point. |

<!-- _class: ability -->

| Licensed Driver [Starter] |
| --- |
| You've gotten lots of practice or training operating vehicles. When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest to use a vehicle to transport supplies or other characters, receive $+d2$ in aid. |

Getaway and Professional Driver each require and extend Licensed Driver.

| Professional Driver |
| --- |
| And almost nothing is stronger than the bond you have with your own ride. You gain access to a vehicle of your choice appropriate to the setting and within reason. When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while operating this vehicle, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ depends on the vehicle and the Stat used, ranging from $-1$ to $+d4$. Moreover, this vehicle has its own backstory which extends your Focus while you operate it. If this vehicle is lost, stolen, or destroyed, replacing it may require time and effort. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Fearless Resolve [Starter] |
| --- |
| You understand that not every loss is necessarily a bad thing. Once per session, when you lose against an Attack, you may reduce the outcome size by one rank and gain a Blessing. |

Charitable and Honorable Resolve each require and extend Fearless Resolve.

| Charitable Resolve |
| --- |
| And what matters most is forgiveness and paying our blessings forward. When you visit a place of religious, spiritual, or community importance, you may spend any number of ‚ë† as a donation or act of service to the place. The more spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the GM. |

| Honorable Resolve |
| --- |
| And it's okay to risk a loss when it means protecting what you care about. You may Attack to protect your honor or loved ones, using Hand or Home instead of Hurt as usual. If you lose the Contest, you receive injuries as though you were Attacked instead. Recharge: ‚ë£. |

### GM Guide: Charitable Resolve's Boon
<!-- _class: guide -->

How you rule the boon given by the "Charitable Resolve" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

However, some ideas are:

- Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
- Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
- Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

<!-- _class: ability -->

| Concerted Effort [Starter] |
| --- |
| It comes naturally to you to read situations to know exactly what other people need. When you spend ‚ë†‚ë† or more to Help another character, they gain a bonus as though you had spent an additional ‚ë†‚ë†. |

Background, Rousing, and Delegated Effort each require and extend Concerted Effort.

| Background Effort |
| --- |
| And you don't mind fading into the background to give a situation just the nudge it needs. You may adjust the "vibe" or "music" of a situation subtly. Others can't pinpoint what changed, but the mood shifts to suit your intent. Recharge: ‚ë£. |

| Rousing Effort |
| --- |
| And people often turn to you for guidance or leadership. Once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell a moving story or give an inspiring speech. Each other character who hears the story or speech gains a Blessing Die. |

| Delegated Effort |
| --- |
| And your skills reading others helps you screen potential allies for teams that work well together. During a Clash Endeavor, your summons may perform Spark rolls by working together in pairs, using one Stat from each, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced and you pay the Blessing Die cost. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Radical Self-Acceptance [Starter] |
| --- |
| You've never been bothered by having your own way of doing things. While you are Uncool, you may roll Checks using a different Stat than normal. Then once a Check succeeds this way, you are no longer Uncool. |

Ascendant and Shameless Self-Acceptance each require and extend Radical Self-Acceptance.

| Ascendant Self-Acceptance |
| --- |
| And this deep sense of trust in yourself has been a wellspring of power for you. You may perform a non-violent Spark roll using $3$ Stat Dice, so long as those Stats each use a $d8$ or larger and you pay double the Blessing Die cost as usual. |

| Shameless Self-Acceptance |
| --- |
| And life's taught you that laughing in the face of obstacles is a great first step in getting through them. Once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell an cringy joke or perform an embarrassing dance. Each other character who hears the joke or witnesses the dance becomes Uncool. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Personal Bounty [Starter] |
| --- |
| You're known in almost any situation for coming prepared or being conveniently light-fingered. When you would fail a Check to see if you already have an item on you, receive $+d2$ in aid. |

Fortune's and Trickster's Bounty each require and extend Personal Bounty.

| Fortune's Bounty |
| --- |
| And you know that if you want to be successful, then you need to make your own luck. When you fail a Check, you may attempt the Check again, using the newer result instead. Recharge: ‚ë§. |

| Trickster's Bounty |
| --- |
| And what's the harm in being prepared for a little razzle-dazzle every now and then? When another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may distract them using an item in your possession, modifying that character's result by $-3$, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss. Recharge: ‚ë§. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Tactful Speech [Starter] |
| --- |
| You're well-versed in idle chatter, spinning conversation, or navigating social milieu. When you would lose a Contest trying to persuade, influence, inspire, or deceive others, receive $+d2$ in aid. |

Popular and Rebutted Speech each require and extend Tactful Speech.

| Popular Speech |
| --- |
| And you know that, truth or fiction, word travels fast. Once per scene, you may end, begin, or modify one rumor. It will spread quickly, within reason, but others are not guaranteed to believe it. Recharge: ‚ë§. |

| Rebutted Speech |
| --- |
| And for you a conversational loss is never a *total* loss. When you lose against a non-violent Attack that was related enough to your Focus, you may have the Attacker receive a less severe version of the same effect you received from losing the Contest. Recharge: ‚ë¢. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Contract Deal [Starter] |
| --- |
| You always know where to make a deal, even if it's not the most sound decision. While you are attempting to purchase goods or services, each ‚ë† you spend to Help yourself is worth ‚ë†‚ë†. |

Wheel, Lifesaving, and Shrouded Deal each require and extend Contract Deal.

| Wheel Deal |
| --- |
| And you'd break a few rules if it means settling debts. When you gain advantage movement in a Race Endeavor, you may create a terrain button anywhere along that movement. Then remove that terrain button once a character begins their movement on the same space as it. |

| Lifesaving Deal |
| --- |
| And what's better than a good deal that keeps you alive? A character may automatically succeed a Check to tend to your wounds, even after they've rolled. Recharge: ‚ë†. When this Ability is recharged, increase the cost to recharge it by ‚ë†‚ë†. |

| Shrouded Deal |
| --- |
| And you know that nothing's more valuable than good info. You may call upon a higher power, criminal underground, book of forbidden knowledge, or so on to gain access to secret information or an answer to a question. This information may come with consequences. Recharge: ‚ë£. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Organized Thoughts [Starter] |
| --- |
| Your memory is like a steel trap&mdash;once you learn something, you almost never forget. When you would fail a Check trying to recall information, receive $+d2$ in aid. |

Shower and Optimal Thoughts each require and extend Organized Thoughts.

| Shower Thoughts |
| --- |
| And you find that your best ideas often come while you're performing your regular duties or self-care. Once per session, when you are in a safe place, you may perform a Check using Head or Heart. Then up to once before the end of the session, you may use the value of that roll instead of rolling for another Check or non-violent Contest. |

| Optimal Thoughts |
| --- |
| And you think it's never a bad idea to back up and analyze the situation before charging forward. Twice per session, you may provide Help by rolling four $d6$ and group those dice into two piles of two. If addition or multiplication could make the piles equal, increase the result of the roll you are Helping by $+5$. For example, $1$, $1$, $1$, and $2$, could be grouped this way as $1√ó2=1+1$. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

Advanced Training requires a $d8$ or larger in at least one Stat.

| Advanced Training |
| --- |
| You aren't just good at what you do&mdash;you've dedicated yourself to it. Each time you bump your dice while using a $d8$ or larger, increase the result of the roll by an additional $+1$. |

Concentration and Ambidexterity Training each require and extend Advanced Training.

| Concentration Training |
| --- |
| And your dedication is clear in the level of focus you bring to your tasks. Your rolls using a $d8$ or larger also bump when you roll a $2$ on the die. |

| Ambidexterity Training |
| --- |
| And your studies have helped you take down your foes ever faster. In a Monstrous Endeavor, when an opponent activates a recovery or revenge button as a result of your Attack, after resolving that button it continues moving however much movement would have been prevented. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Ability Synchrony |
| --- |
| You may spend ‚äú‚äú to loan one of your Abilities to another willing character in the scene. This effect lasts until the end of the scene or sooner if you choose. |

| History Synchrony |
| --- |
| You may spend ‚äú‚äú to exchange Focus elements with another willing character in the scene. This effect lasts until the end of the scene or sooner if you choose. |

| Spark Synchrony |
| --- |
| You may perform a Spark roll using one of your Stats and one of the Stats of another willing character in the scene, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced, both characters have this Ability, and the Blessing Die cost is paid between the two characters. Doing so is considered acting as a group. |

| Enmity Synchrony |
| --- |
| During a Contest against another individual, before either character rolls, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to act synchronously with your opponent. If you do, the two of you perform your rolls at the same time. When either of you would bump, you both bump. You both still maintain your own separate roll totals. This Ability may not be used to direct Focal Actions. |

## Items
<!-- _class: center creation -->

> *There is not an appendix of items to choose from in this game. Instead, items are narrative and help shape the course of the story.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Character Creation: Step Five!
<!-- _class: creation -->

Finally, **describe your character's appearance** and list **three or four items** your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you begin the game with.

You'll track a list of items that you typically carry with you, and other items you may have can be **determined in the moment**: Over the course of the story, you may perform Checks to **find** new items, **create** new items, **purchase and sell** items, and even see if you **already have** items that could be narratively reasonable for you to have.

And while most items are narrative, some **higher quality items** you acquire along the way may provide aid or effects similar to some Abilities.

### GM Guide: Creating NPCs
<!-- _class: guide -->

You do not need to go through the entire character creation process to create NPCs for your table. Instead, you only need the following and may improvise the rest:

- Focus and History Stat Die.
- What the NPC's motivation and quirks are and how they relate to two PCs' histories.
- One other Stat's Die that is unusually high or low compared to the rest.
- One Stat Die shared by all the other Stats.
- At most one Ability. If the Ability would require recharging to be used, instead roll a $d6$ as though gaining a Blessing Die. If the NPC would gain a Blessing Die worth enough to recharge the Ability, instead recharge the Ability immediately.

## Session Shop
<!-- _class: center ability -->

> *Now that you've built your first character, let's play! And after your first session, keep reading to find out what upgrade options are available in the Session Shop!*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Session Shop Upgrades
<!-- _class: ability -->

At the end of each session, you receive one free upgrade for your character. Upgrade options are listed below. Some upgrades you receive immediately, and some you receive at the end of the following session.

You may also spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to receive an additional upgrade beyond the one you receive for free. You may keep spending Blessings to receive additional upgrades this way, but each additional upgrade costs ‚ë†‚ë† more than the last.

| Stat Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may upgrade a single Stat's die one size. If you do, you receive this upgrade immediately. You may only receive this upgrade $10$ times. |
| When you receive the Stat Upgrade, you may, as a free adjustment, downgrade one of your Stat Dice one size and upgrade a different Stat Die one size instead.|
| When you upgrade or downgrade the size of your History Stat Die, you may, as a free adjustment, receive the Focus Upgrade for free, limited to only one change or addition to your Focus. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Focus Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may upgrade your Focus based on the events of the session by making two changes, two additions, or one of each to it. Your Focus may not have more than seven things listed. If you choose this upgrade, you receive this upgrade immediately. |

| Ability Upgrade |
| --- |
| You may use your upgrade to gain an additional Ability. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. You may only receive this upgrade $2$ times. |
| When you receive the Ability Upgrade, you may, as a free adjustment, lose one non-extended Ability and replace it with another Ability. |

| Item Upgrade |
| ------------ |
| You may upgrade one of your mundane items to a higher quality, within reason, so that it provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect. If you do, you receive this upgrade immediately. |

---
<!-- _class: ability -->

| Carefree Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Carefree, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Blossomed, Prodigious, or Crafty. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Eager Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Eager, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Driven, Chosen, or Wired. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Wisened Upgrade |
| --- |
| If your starting Lifestyle was Wisened, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Steadfast, Warry, or Compelling. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

| Lost Upgrade |
| --- |
| Regardless of your starting Lifestyle, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to Lost. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. Then, once your Lifestyle is Lost, you may upgrade your Lifestyle to any other option. If you do, you receive this upgrade at the end of the following session. |

### GM Guide: Catching Players Up
<!-- _class: guide -->

Offer players one additional free upgrade at the end of sessions when they would have fewer total upgrades than the player with the most total upgrades.

# Playing the Game
<!-- _class: center major rules -->

## Rolls, Checks, and Contests
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *An "action" is anything you choose for your character to do. Some actions require you to perform rolls to determine the outcome. The simplest of these are Checks and Contests. The rules for more complex types of actions build up from there.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Spark Rolls
<!-- _class: rules -->

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

When rolling a Stat Die, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to perform a Spark roll instead, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each.

These Spark rolls represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination&mdash;and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark roll also apply to the Spark roll itself.

You may decide to turn a roll into a Spark roll before or after you've made your first roll for the action.

For example, when you roll your first $1$ on the die, you may decide to take extra advantage of this opportunity. If you do, pay the Blessing Die cost to Spark, roll your second die, then reroll both dice for the bump, and add it all together.

### Checks
<!-- _class: rules -->

To perform a Check:

1. **Roll:** Roll the die for the action's associated Stat. The GM will let you know which to use.
2. **Outcome:** If the result of the roll meets or beats the GM's target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

Also note, your History Stat is used to perform actions more related to your backstory than your other Stats. When both your History Stat and another Stat would be applicable in a situation, the GM may decide which applies more. Otherwise, you choose which to use.

### GM Guide: Setting Check Targets
<!-- _class: guide -->

In the table below, Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $1$ to $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.

| Difficulty | Target | Corresponding Outcome Size |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Lowest Possible | $3$ | Very Minor |
| Easy | $4$ | Minor |
| Medium | $8$ | Medium |
| Hard | $12$ | Major |
| Very Hard | $16$ | Very Major |
| Trial | $20$ | Maximum |

### GM Guide: Setting Targets for Magic
<!-- _class: guide -->

If your setting has "magic" or other supernatural, reality-bending player capabilities, the way you set targets for these Checks depends on the nature of "magic" in your setting. 

We recommend providing your players a table that describes your "magic" targets for them:

- Each row of the table corresponds to an outcome size, from Very Minor to Maximum.
- Each column corresponds to a "school of magic" or category of supernatural effect.
- Each cell describes examples of what a supernatural action of that outcome size and category might look like.
- Players and you determine which cells are most like what the player wants to achieve with their effect, and the highest outcome size among those cells is the outcome size their roll will need to meet, with you having final say on the exact Check target.
- Increase the outcome size they need to hit if they are pushing the area, duration, or nature of the effect further than normal; if they are untrained in the effect or it is outside their "school of magic"; or if the effect requires forbidden knowledge.
- Performing supernatural effects requiring beyond a Maximum outcome size requires a "quest" to do so.

### Automatic History Check Success
<!-- _class: rules -->

At GM discretion, you may automatically succeed History Checks if your Focus is related enough to the Check and your History Stat Die is high enough, according to the table below.

| History Stat Die | Maximum Check target for automatic success |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $d2$  | *Unavailable* |
| $d4$  | $4$  |
| $d6$  | $8$ |
| $d8$  | $12$ |
| $d10$ | $16$ |

If you choose to automatically succeed this way, you succeed as though you had rolled exactly the Check's target, this roll cannot be modified by other effects, and the resulting outcome size (described later in this section) is reduced by one rank.

You may not choose to automatically succeed Checks this way to direct Focal Actions (described later in this chapter).

### Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character's will using any Stat besides Hurt.

To perform a non-violent Contest:

1. **Attack:** The Attacker rolls the appropriate Stat.
2. **Defense:** The Defender rolls the same Stat as the Attacker. If the Attacker uses a Spark roll, then the Defender may roll a Spark roll using either or both of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark roll, so long as the Defender pays the Blessing Die cost.
3. **Outcome:** The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The size of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character's will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially dangerous. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest:

1. **Attack:** The Attacker first rolls their Hurt Stat or a Spark roll that involves Hurt.
2. **Defense:** The Defender rolls their Hurry Stat or Spark roll that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene.
3. **Outcome:** The action's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The extent of the injury is determined by the difference between their scores, regardless if that was what the Attacker intended.
4. **Additional Attacks:** If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor.
5. **Additional Defenses:** Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these continued Attacks with a greater range of options than just Hurry, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note, Checks use the terms "fail," "succeed," and "target," while Contests use "lose," "win," "Attack," and "Defend" instead.

When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks.

For example, the "Fortune's Bounty" Ability allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win.

The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Outcome Sizes
<!-- _class: rules -->

In general, rolling higher leads to bigger outcomes.

Some rules refer to the "size" of an outcome, from Very Minor to Maximum, as determined by the table below.

| Outcome size | Succeed a Check by rolling: | Win a Contest by rolling this much more than your opponent: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Minor | 1&ndash;3 | 0&ndash;1 |
| Minor | 4&ndash;7 | 2&ndash;3 |
| Medium | 8&ndash;11 | 4&ndash;5 |
| Major | 12&ndash;15 | 6&ndash;7 |
| Very Major | 16&ndash;19 | 8&ndash;9 |
| Maximum | 20 or more | 10 or more |

These outcome sizes help your GM rule what happens as a result of Checks and Contests.

### GM Guide: Effect of Contest Outcomes
<!-- _class: guide -->

| Outcome size | Contest effect |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Very Minor or Minor | Attacker gets what they want, with complications, and the advantage is momentary. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain an Ache. |
| Medium | Attacker gets what they want, without complications, and the advantage lasts several rolls or shifts the narrative of the scene. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain an Ache or Pain. |
| Major or Very Major | Attacker gets what they want, and the ramifications may be serious though not life-threathening, shifting the narrative arc of the session or several sessions. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain a Weakness or Vulnerability. |
| Maximum | Attacker has likely gone too far for what they intended. Effects are serious, possibly needing immediate attention or miracle, shifting the narrative arc of several sessions or the campaign. For violent Contests, the Defender could gain multiple Weaknesses or Vulnerabilities |

### GM Guide: Describing Violent Effects
<!-- _class: guide -->

When describing the results of violent effects dealt to or by the player characters, don't only rely on status conditions or descriptions of injuries.

Include variety over the course of the campaign: What does the Attacker *want*? The character's motivations should drive the narrative, not just the game mechanics.

You may treat Minor and Medium violent effects as ways the Attacker can get at what they want from the Defender in the scene, which is not always to just inflict injury on others.

And you may treat Major violent effects as representing going too far using violent means to get what one wants.

When a character suffers a Major violent effect, it can be unsatisfying for them to be immediately incapacitated or, in the extreme, removed from the game.

Instead, you might draw the tension and possibility to respond out further. One way to do so is to provide the affected character's allies opportunity to perform a Home Contest against the same roll that the Attacker used to inflict the Major violent effect.

If an ally wins the Contest by $4$ or more, then the violent effect is successfully mitigated, perhaps reducing it to a Medium or Minor effect. However, if the Attacker is able to roll $8$ or more on a Hurt Check before the allies can successfully treat the effect, then the Attacker may deliver a *coup de grace*.

## Helping and Complex Actions
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *There are special rules or considerations for when characters perform complex actions, work together as a group, and give and receive Help.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Group Checks and Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group. There are two general approaches:

- **Provide Help:** One way is to provide Help (described later in this section) to one roll that leads the group's action. Some members of the group may decide not to roll and instead wait for the group leader to roll, then provide Help to the leader by spending Blessings to increase the result of the roll.
- **Median Roll:** Another way is for each character to roll for the action, using the median of their rolls as the group's shared result. If the group roll had an even number of individual rolls, then the higher of the two median rolls is used. The table below provides a quick reference.

| Rolls made | Roll used |
| ---------- | --------- |
| $2$ | Highest |
| $3$ | Second highest |
| $4$ | Second highest |
| $5$ | Third highest |
| $6$ | Third highest |
| $7$ | Fourth highest |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

These two approaches may even be combined, with some members rolling and taking their median, and the other members providing Help on top of that median. However, a group member cannot both roll and Help for the same action.

In general, once characters become a group as part of a Check or Contest, they remain a group until the end of the Check or Contest and are treated as a single character for the sake of the rules, sharing benefits and risks.

Also note, a character cannot force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

### Helping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters may spend their Blessing Dice to Help one another complete Checks and Contests. And your Abilities, events, and items in the story may also Help you in similar ways.

Once per roll, whether your own or another character's, you may Help by spending a number of Blessing Dice, then that character rolls a die and adds the result to their roll. The more Blessing Dice spent this way, the larger the die rolled, according to the table below.

| Blessing Dice Spent | Bonus Added |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| ‚ë† | $+1$ |
| ‚ë†‚ë† | $+d2$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 4$ | $+d4$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 6$ | $+d6$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 8$ | $+d8$ |
| ‚ë† $\times 10$ | $+d10$ |

The dice used for Help effects do not bump.

And you may only Help other characters if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action and your character is not currently engaged in another action.

### Receiving Situational Aid
<!-- _class: rules -->

While you and your allies may spend Blessings to Help one another, in certain situations your Abilities, items, environment, careful planning, or so on can provide you additional Help as well&mdash;and for free!

These effects describe a possible failed Check or lost Contest and say to "receive $+X$ in aid" in response. When you do, you gain a $+X$ bonus to the roll, as though you were Helped by the situation, possibly turning the failure into a success or loss into a win.

You may only receive situational aid once per roll. If multiple effects would provide situational aid during the same roll, you choose which one to use.

### Overcharged Stats
<!-- _class: rules -->

Lifestyle upgrade options overcharge one or two of a character's Stats.

When you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while performing a Spark roll using an overcharged Stat, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ is the same sized die used in the Spark roll.

### Complex Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes a character's Attack is itself a complex action normally requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

In such cases, the GM may set a threshold the Attacker needs to clear. The Attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the GM's threshold.

When the Defender rolls, if the Defender rolls lower than the GM's threshold, the Contest is resolved as though the Defender had rolled that threshold instead.

This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to clear the threshold.

### Delayed Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes Attacks are made that are Defended against at a later time, such as setting traps or sending letters.

Such delayed Attacks are performed as Contests as usual with the following adjustments:

- **Delay:** The Attacker performs their roll, decribes what condition would activate the Attack, and writes these both down.
- **Activate:** The Defender rolls against the Attacker's roll whenever the Attack would be activated.

Also note, the Attacker cannot activate "receive aid" effects if they are not present when the Attack is activated. The Defender can still activate "receive aid" effects as usual.

### Long Actions
<!-- _class: rules -->

A long action is any action that is multi-step, spans a longer period of time than most other actions, and involves the scope of multiple Stats.

For example:

- Formulating a plan for a heist
- Engaging in political intrigue
- Crafting or reparing specialized items
- Navigating and piloting a crewed vessel
- Running a business
- Searching ruins for forbidden knowledge while avoiding bounty hunters' detection

There are two approaches the GM may take to resolve long actions:

- **Simple:** The GM may ask for a single Check or Contest, using only the single Stat that the long action's success or victory most turns on. The target for success or victory without difficulties or complications may be higher than usual in this case.
- **Thorough:** The GM may ask for multiple Checks or Contests using the various Stats involved in the long action. For overall success or victory, at least half of these rolls will need to win or succeed. However, each failure or loss may incur difficulties or complications on top of that success.

### Scrambling Contests
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some Contests are fast and chaotic, with both sides rapidly changing their plans and the Stats that would be involved&mdash;yet without amounting to the level of tension covered by Simultaneous Actions and Eneavors described later in this chapter. For example: quick bouts, fisticuffs, cartoonish outbreaks of "violence," or short and dramatic card games.

To perform a scrambling Contest:

1. **Half-Baked Attacks:** Quickly choose a Stat to roll, as though you were Attacking. The narrative for your Attacks do not have to be fully formed&mdash;just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats may be chosen for this Contest.
2. **Scramble:** If you rolled highest, you choose how to "scramble" the Contest. Choose which Stats everyone uses for the next roll, and you may choose different Stats for different characters. You just can't choose a Stat for a character that the character has already rolled this Contest. 
3. **Repeat:** Repeat the above step until a character has no Stats left to roll.
4. **Final Round:** If you rolled the highest during the final round of rolls, you win the overall Contest. But if you rolled very low on any of your rolls in previous rounds, then your victory may have complications.
5. **Outcome Size:** Narrate and determine the final outcome of the Contest. The outcome is determined using your final roll as an Attack and everyone else's rolls as a group Defense.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

Also note, if a character Sparks a roll during a scrambling Contest:

- The Spark roll must involve the Stat chosen for the character to use.
- The Spark roll may not involve a Stat the character has already rolled for that Contest.
- The Spark roll uses up both Stats involved for that Contest.

### Coming Prepared
<!-- _class: rules -->

You may perform a Home Check to see if you already came prepared with just the item you need.

The target you will need to reach may depend on details such as:

- How common, niche, specialized, rare, or unique in the world the desired item is.
- How probable it would be to already have that item.
- How many items your character already has listed.

Also, when you fail a Check to see if you already came prepared with an item, you may be unable to perform these Checks again until the end of the scene or session. And if you fail by a large amount, you may drop or break other items in your possession while digging around in your bag, alert others to your location, or so on.

### Shopping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Performing Home Checks to shop, trade, or so on is similar to performing Home Checks to see if you already came prepared with an item.

The difference is that if you are shopping in a place where it would be reasonable to find the desired item, and if would be reasonable for you to have the money or goods to trade for that item, then you may receive situational aid on the Check.

And like coming prepared, if you fail a Check to shop, you may be unable to do so again until the end of the scene or session, you may lose one of your other items in a bad deal, you may anger shopkeepers or be accused of shoplifting, or so on.

### Crafting
<!-- _class: rules -->

Crafting new items from your surroundings, tools, and supplies is a long action. This is because crafting usually requires a number of tasks that span the scope of multiple Stats:

- Gathering high quality supplies (Home)
- Gaining knowledge of how to construct the desired object (Head)
- Gathering or constructing the necessary tools (Hand or Home)
- Constructing the desired object, which can involve multiple steps depending on the complexity (Hand)
- Improvising adjustments when tools or supplies break or when one's initial plans were imperfect (Heart)
- Meddling with the forces of the universe (Hex, Ham, Hologram, or so on, for settings that have a Stat for the "magic" of the world)

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

The target you will need to hit for this craft long action will depend on the intended "quality" or effect of your desired item:

| Item quality | Typical outcome size | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Mundane | Very Minor or Minor | Narrative function only |
| High-Quality Mundane | Medium | Provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect |
| Powered | Major or Very Major | Provides a "receive $+d2$ in aid" effect |

Also note, crafted items may come with flaws, even if you succeed overall. How flaws are introduced depends on how the GM chooses to resolve the craft long action:

- **Simple:** The GM may provide two targets for you to hit. To succeed you will need to hit the lower target, but to succeed without flaws or limitations you will need to hit the higher target.
- **Thorough:** The GM may require you to make multiple Checks. To succeed at crafting you will need to succeed on at least half of the individual Checks, with each failed Check introducing the chance for a flaw or limitation.

### Setting Out
<!-- _class: rules -->

You and your fellow players may propose plans that could direct how you set out on a series of scenes, sessions, or whole campaign. When you do, the GM may ask for a set of rolls similar to a group long action.

Each roll in this group long action will correspond to a different necessary step of your group's plans. Then, based on the results, the GM may provide different amounts or types of information to set you off on your "quest," representing your group's capabilities at planning and preparation.

## Simultaneous Actions and Endeavors
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *There are special rules for when several characters are working towards competing aims at the same time.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### The Camera Rule
<!-- _class: rules -->

To resolve complex situations where several actions are competing for control of the narrative, *Humanity, Blessed* follows The "Camera Rule," inspired by how complex scenes are handled in film and television.

The "Camera Rule" has four parts:

- **No Two Places at Once:** A character cannot be a part of multiple Contests or Checks at the same time.
- **One Focal Action:** When multiple characters attempt to perform actions that would require Checks or Contests at the same time, only one of these actions can direct the central narrative. This is the Focal Action.
- **Side Actions:** Other actions that were attempted at the same moment, the Side Actions, could still occur in the background.
- **Incomplete Actions:**  Side Actions could also be interrupted, muddled by the chaos of the situation, abandoned by the character in response to the results of the Focal Action, or so on. Such incomplete actions are not considered wins, losses, failures, or successes&mdash;they simply don't go all the way from idea to execution.

### Simultaneous Actions
<!-- _class: rules -->

When several characters want to complete conflicting actions, all at the same time as they compete towards their respective goals, this requires a round of simultaneous actions.

To resolve a round of simultaneous actions, follow these steps:

1. **Group Up:** You cannot roll and provide Help at the same time, so don't rush to roll at the top of the round. If you and your allies would like to provide Help to one another, first decide how you will form groups, then act as a group accordingly from there. Also note, once characters become grouped, they remain grouped for the rest of the round.
2. **Direct the Focal Action:** All characters roll for their attempted actions, as though they were performing their desired Check or Attack. Only the highest of these rolls directs the Focal Action, with the GM resolving ties.
3. **Resolve the Focal Action:** The Focal Action is then resolved as a Check or Contest as usual.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

4. **Determine and Resolve any Side Actions:** One at a time, starting with those that rolled the lowest to direct the Focal Action, Side Actions are determined and resolved  as a Check or Contest as usual. However:
    - You cannot act if you have already been involved in a Check or Contest this round, regardless if it was by choice.
    - You cannot involve other characters in your action if those characters have already been involved in a Check or Contest this round.
    - When it is your turn to act, you may:
        - Continue with your original idea or adapt it to the new situation around you, keeping the roll you made to direct the Focal Action.
        - Follow a brand new idea, performing a new roll.
        - Wait to group up with another character or abandon acting altogether.
5. **End:** Once all characters have either been involved in an action or chosen not to act, the round of simultaneous actions is resolved.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

For example, if two characters are Attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attempt to Attack. Then only the higher roll goes through as both an Attack and directs the Focal Action. The lower roll has been interrupted, neither winning, losing, failing, or succeeding. Then the lower roller Defends against the Attack, narrating how they respond, and effects are determined as usual. And as there were only two characters in this exchange, there were no opportunities for Side Actions by other characters.

For another example, two groups are competing in a battle of the bands, the *Dropkicks* and the *Blast Offffs!*, while a groupie named Sam cheers for the *Dropkicks* from the stands. First, the two groups roll Headline (a special Stat for the setting) and the groupie rolls Heart, all narrating how they attempt to act. Then only the highest of these three rolls directs the Focal Action. Let's say it's the *Dropkicks*, and with their music they attempted to summon a dragon of pure music to Attack the *Blast Offffs!*. So, the *Blast Offffs!* now Defend against that Attack, with their original plan now interrupted. Finally, as a Side Action, Sam may continue with their original plan of cheering from the stands, or they may adjust their strategy and choose a different roll in response to the outcome of the *Dropkicks*'s Attack.

## Conditions
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *While most effects serve to shape the narrative of the game, your GM may find it appropriate to also apply conditions to characters when the situation calls for it.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### Surprise Threat
<!-- _class: rules -->

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump, cannot be a Spark roll, and cannot be an automatic History Check success.

### Coolness
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may attempt a Check to remove this condition.

### GM Guide: Becoming Uncool
<!-- _class: guide -->

The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

So when you build the narrative around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Wounds
<!-- _class: rules -->

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Nor do you have any "defensive" Stats. When you're hit, you're hit.

In this game, wounds primarily serve to shape narrative arcs. The worse the wound, the longer lasting the impact and the greater lengths you may have to go to treat them.

However, some injuries you receive may affect specific Stats, and these effects may range in degree. The lowest degree injury conditions are "aches," and the worst are "vulnerabilities."

- **Ache:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. This condition lasts until the end of the scene. *For example, Headache, Handcramp, Heartache, and Homesick.*
- **Pain:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat are made with a $-1$ modifier. This condition lasts until you rest in a safe place. *For example, Migraine, Soreness, Sadness, and Robbery.*
- **Weakness:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat cannot receive Help, including aid from items, Abilities, or situations. This condition lasts until it is treated. *For example, Confusion, Exhaustion, Dejection, and Illness.*
- **Vulnerability:** When an opposing character witnesses you perform a roll using the affected Stat, they may have you perform the roll again and use the new value. This condition lasts until it is treated. *For example, Memory Loss, Numbness, Wretchedness, and Destitution.*

### Other Conditions
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Agreeable to $X$:** Rolls you make to Defend against $X$ that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. If $X$ does an action or makes a request that would bring you harm, this condition ends.
- **Famous:** You may exert your fame over a character who is less famous than you, gaining a $+d2$ bonus in a Contest against them. You may not do so against the same character more than once during the same session or while you are Uncool.
- **Muddled:** The next roll you make to direct a Focal Action is made with a $-2$ modifier. Then, this condition ends.
- **Cursed:** Dice in your pool of Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $0$. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Distracted:** Rolls you make do not bump. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Disarmed:** If you would land a violent Attack with a Maximum outcome, you win with a Very Major outcome instead. When you find a new weapon or take a moment to recompose yourself, this condition ends.
- **Taxed:** You cannot perform Spark rolls. Spending ‚ë†‚ë† ends this condition.

## Special Endeavors
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *There are a number of special types of Endeavors in this game, which add additional obstacles, actions, restrictions, and win conditions to the basic rules for Endeavors described above. Work with your GM to know which to expect in your campaign.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### 
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters race against one another or their opponents, whether it be on foot, on horseback, in sleds, in cars, or even in spaceships!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Endurance Checks:** At the end of each round, if a character spent Blessings that round, they must succeed a Check to remain in the race, representing the character's endurance to keep racing after a hard push. The target for this Check is equal to the total number of Blessings the character has spent this Endeavor.
- **Terrain Buttons:** At the top of the first round, the GM will describe the shape of the race course, adding a number of "terrain buttons" to the number line to represent hills, brush, holes, asteroid fields, or so on that slow the racers down. The first time a character would pass a terrain button's position on the number line, they instead end that movement on the same space as the button.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Escape Bonus:** If a character gains advantage movement, and they began that movement on the same space as a terrain button, they gain two bonuses to their advantage movement. First, they move forward on the number line an additional $+2$. And second, they may ignore up to one terrain button they would pass during this movement.
- **Types of Terrain Buttons:** The GM may add multiple types of terrain buttons to the number line, representing different types of terrain obstacles for the area, such as hills, stampedes, quantum puzzles, or trolley problem moral dilemmas. When a character begins the round on a terrain button, the type of the terrain button may constrain what Stats they may roll or what actions they may take.

### 
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Alarm Buttons:** At the start of the Endeavor, the GM adds a number of "alarm buttons" throughout the number line. If a character ends its first movement of the round on the same space as an alarm button, then the character is "made" by the watchful eye they are trying to avoid. What happens when a character is made this way depends on the Encounter. For example, the party immediately loses when any character is made. Or after a number of times being made, the Endeavor changes. Or when a character is made, they perform a Check whose target is equal to the button's position on the number line, and the character is removed from the Endeavor if they fail that Check. Or so on.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Alarm Buttons Move:** At the end of each round, the alarm buttons move, according to some set pattern only the GM knows. Nothing happens immediately when an alarm button ends its movement in the same space as a character. However, if a character chooses to sit out from directing the Focal Action while sharing a space with an alarm button, then the chatacter is made just as though they had moved onto it.
- **Failed Checks Increase Alertness:** When a character fails a Check or loses a Contest while resolving a Focal Action or Side Action, the "alertness" of the Endeavor increases, represented by an additional alarm button being added to the number line.
- **Negative Help:** When a character receives Help, they may choose to subtract the bonus from their roll instead of adding it as usual.

## Endeavors
<!-- _class: center rules -->

> *There are a number of special types of Endeavors in this game, which add additional obstacles, actions, restrictions, and win conditions to the basic rules for Endeavors described above. Work with your GM to know which to expect in your campaign.*
> *&mdash;snotskie*

### General Endeavor Rules
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes, the player characters will need to race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on! Many such scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents.

Different types of Endeavors build on these same general rules:

- **Roll:** At the start of each round, choose a Stat to roll. The narrative for your rolls do not have to be fully formed, just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Actions:** Endeavors describe a set of actions characters may choose from when it is their turn to act. Some actions use your roll from the start of the round, some have other characters roll a new value, and some ignore these rolls altogether. The GM may limit the actions you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Special Actions:** Some actions have the **[Special Action]** label. You may only use these actions if you rolled the highest at the start of the round.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Turn Order:** After rolls are made for the round, whoever rolled highest acts first, using a special action if they wish. Then, all other characters act in order from lowest roll and up.
- **Interruptions:** Each round you may only take one action. Additionally, if you are Attacked by an opponent, then you lose your action for the round.
- **Movement:** Endeavors use a number line to track character positions, scores, progress towards goals, or so on. The Endeavor's setup instructions will describe where characters begin on the number line and its actions will describe when and how you move.
- **Group Movement:** If a winning or succeeding side in any of the steps above is a group, then when they move forward an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.
- **Buttons:** Endeavors add a number of buttons to the number line. There are two types of buttons, personal and global. Personal buttons can only be activated by the character who added them, whereas global buttons can be activated by any character. If an Endeavor uses buttons, it will describe how each is activated and the effect that happens as a result.

### GM Guide: Simplified Endeavor Rolls
<!-- _class: guide -->

Occassionaly limiting the Stats that are applicable each round can help provide structure and flavor for your Endeavors. For example:

- The party is ambushed. Ambushers roll Hurt, and the ambushed roll Hurry.
- The party is playing a game of giant magic chess and each round must roll Head or Hand.
- Two bands and their groupies are competing in a battle of the bands. Band members must roll Headline, and groupies must roll something else.
- An avalanche occurs mid-Endeavor. All characters must roll Hurry. Anyone who fails to clear a threshold cannot act this round.

In any case, keep in mind how your players actually think about the Endeavor and what their goals are!

Simplifying Endeavor rolls this way removes player autonomy, but it also (a) lowers the cognitive load of thinking up a narrative for one's actions and (b) creates rules around the Endeavor that can make it feel distinct from other Endeavors in the campaign.

### GM Guide: Simplified Endeavor Check Targets
<!-- _class: guide -->

Instead of determining a target for each Check in an Endeavor, for most Checks you may allow characters to automatically succeed, but then compare the size of their outcome to the effect they wanted to achieve. Based on that, award them a weaker or stronger or moreorless complete version of that intended effect.

This allows you to reserve setting targets for Checks where failure would be interesting or that would change the arc of the Endeavor.

If you use this approach, characters would be unable to activate "receive aid" Abilities for Checks. So, make it clear the start of the Endeavor if, for the sake of the Endeavor, such Abilities (a) always activate, even without explicit failure, or (b) never activate because of the dire pressure of the situation.

### GM Guide: Multiple Number Lines
<!-- _class: guide -->

In Endeavors covering a larger playing field where it would be narratively unsatisfying for characters in different regions of the field to affect one another, you may split the Endeavor into two, at most three, number lines.

Depending on the situation, characters may be able to change the number line they are on, may be able to only if they succeed a Check or pay a movement cost, or may be able to only if the situation allows.

Regardless, the Endeavor still only has one Focal Action per round. What changes is that characters are limited in who they can interact with based on which number line they are on.

### GM Guide: Large-Scale Endeavors
<!-- _class: guide -->

Resolving actions that occur on massive scales&mdash;such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster&mdash;requires shifting the scale of the narrative.

This may be done in an Endeavor by spending one round at the large-scale action before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them for the next several rounds.

The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

### üõ°Ô∏è Clash Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters summoning, rallying, or inspiring allies to face off against an opposing side's summoned, rallied, or inspired allies&mdash;such as soldiers in your command, athletes you are coaching, creature companions you have befriended, knights dueling as your champions, spirits you are channeling, or spectral monsters you've summoned by playing music so well!

- **Setup:** You, your allies, and your opponents do not have a position. Instead, both sides begin the Endeavor with two "summons" on their side at position $0$. A "summon" is a character or other entity you have summoned to your side for the Endeavor, and a "summoner" is any character or group summoning others to their side. A summon is a character for the sake of wording in the rules, and generally a summon is considered to have existed before they were summoned to your side&mdash;"being summoned" just places them into the game's evolving story.
- **Goal:** How you win depends on the scene in question. It could be when one of your summons activates a certain number of victory buttons or when you've captured enough of the opposing side's summons.

*Continued on next page.*

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

- **Actions:** There are a number of actions that summons and summoners may choose from during the Endeavor, described in the Summon Action and Summoner Action tables below. At GM discretion, some summons' Abilities may grant them additional actions.
- **Buttons:** Some Clash Endeavors begin with a number of victory buttons, described in the Button table below.

| Summon Action | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;an Attack | Use your roll to perform an Attack against an opposing summon who has not acted this round. They roll a new value to Defend with. Whoever loses this Contest moves down by the amount they lost by. |
| Perform&nbsp;a Check | Use your roll to perform a Check to advance your team's objectives. Move up equal to half your roll, rounded down. |
| Attempt&nbsp;a Capture | [Special Action] Move up equal to half your roll, rounded down. Then choose an opposing summon and move yourself down any amount. That opposing summon then rolls a new value to Defend against the number of spaces you moved down. If they lose this Contest, they are "captured" and removed from the Endeavor. |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

| Summoner Action | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;a Check | Use your roll to perform a Check to advance your team's objectives. Move one of your summons up equal to half your roll, rounded down. |
| Provide Help | Ignore your roll. Choose one of your summons who has not acted this round to form a group with. On their action, you may provide Help to increase their roll. |
| Summon&nbsp;an Ally | [Special Action] Use your roll to perform a Check to call a new summon to your side at position $0$. The larger the outcome size of this Check, the more powerful the summon called |

| Button | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Victory | *Type:* Global. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it. *Effect:* End your movement and remove this button. |

### GM Guide: Stats for Summons
<!-- _class: guide -->

For simplicity, Summons may use Stats similar to how Monstrosities use them. You may use the following table as a starting point for converting rolls to summon Stats.

| Roll | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| $3$ or less | Summon fails. |
| $4$ to $7$ | Summon uses $d4$ and $d2$ for Stats. |
| $8$ to $11$ | Summon uses $d4$ for Stats. |
| $12$ to $15$ | Summon uses $d6$ and $d4$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $d4$ and has an extra Ability. |
| $16$ to $19$ | Summon uses $d8$ and $d6$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $d6$ and has an extra Ability. |
| $20$ or more | Summon uses $d10$ and $d8$ for Stats. Or, summon uses $d8$ and $d6$ and has an extra Ability. Or, summon uses $d6$ and has two extra Abilities. |

You may also allow your players to determine their "pool" of summons ahead of time through roleplay, if it makes sense for the campaign setting.

In any case, giving summons their Stats and getting them onto the number line should be a *quick* process.

### üîé Discovery Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters explore a mansion for clues, search through the rubble of a crashed spaceship, delve into a dungeon, or so on!

- **Setup:** You and your allies begin at position $0$. At the top of the first round, the GM will provide the lay of the land of the environment you're exploring, such as what rooms are available and how they relate. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own number line and lay of the land. 
- **Goal:** Exploration.
- **Actions:** There are two normal actions and one special action you and your allies may choose from during the Endeavor, described in the Action table below.
- **Buttons:** When the GM gives a lay of the land, a number of glimmer buttons of will be added, described in the Button table below. The GM may add multiple types of glimmer buttons to the number line, representing different types of discoveries for the area, such as items, information, social interactions, or further areas to explore.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;a Check | Use your roll to perform a Check to advance your team's objectives. Move up equal to half your roll, rounded down. You may choose to end this movement early. |
| Provide Help | Ignore your roll. Choose an ally who has not acted this round to form a group with. On their action, you may provide Help to increase their roll. |
| Inspect&nbsp;a Glimmer | **[Special Action]** Move up equal to your roll. You may choose to end this movement early. If you activate a glimmer button this round with a Check related to your roll, you may use your roll for the Check instead of rolling a new value. |

| Button | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Glimmer | *Type:* Global. *Activation:* You may activate this button when you end your turn on it. *Effect:* Remove this button and perform any Checks or other actions associated with it. If this button has a Check, roll a new value for the Check, and the target for the Check will be equal to the glimmer button's position. |

### GM Guide: Preparing Glimmer Buttons
<!-- _class: guide -->

You do not need to specify ahead of time which discoveries correspond to each glimmer button. Instead, decide which categories of discoveries might be present in the area: items, information, social interactions, traps, or so on.

Then, for each, decide how copious it might be in the area:

- **Rare:** Roll $1d4-2$ and if the result is positive add that many glimmer buttons of that type to the number line. This die bumps as usual. (For even rarer discoveries, you may roll $1d4-3$ or $1d4-4$ instead.)
- **Uncommon:** Do the same as above, but with $1d4$.
- **Common:** Do the same as above, but with $1d6$.
- **Abundant:** Do the same as above, but with $1d8$.
- **Copious:** Do the same as above, but with $1d10$.

---
<!-- _class: guide -->

Then, improvise following your players' choices. For example, when they decide to interact with a "loot" glimmer at position $10$ instead of a "social" glimmer, ask yourself:

- What are they looking for?
- What Stat did they use to reach it?
- What would a "loot" of target $10$ look like?
- What might be available in this area?
- How does this area relate to the larger area and events of the story?
- What information can you present alongside it?
- What item, result, or information could be given for free based on the character's Focus?
- If the character will need to roll a new Check to interact with the glimmer, what Stat can you ask them to roll that will add new detail to the scene without being the same Stat they just rolled?



### üßü Monstrous Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

- **Setup:** You and your allies begin at position $0$. Your opponents begin higher up, each add defeat buttons at position $0$, and each add recovery buttons somewhere else. Stronger opponents begin further from $0$, may have Abilities, and may enter the Endeavor with Blessing Dice of their own.
- **Goal:** To win, move all your opponents to position $0$ without your team being captured first.
- **Actions:** There are three normal actions and one special action you and your allies may choose from during the Endeavor, described in the Player Action table below. Your opponents also have a number of actions, described in the Monstrosity Action table below. Some Monstrosity's Abilities grant them additional actions.
- **Buttons:** Your opponents enter the Endeavor with a number of buttons, described in the Monstrosity Button table below.

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

| Player Action | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;an Attack | Use your roll to perform an Attack against an opponent who has not acted this round. They roll a new value to Defend with. Whoever loses this Contest moves down by the amount they lost by. |
| Perform&nbsp;a Check | Use your roll to perform a Check to advance your team's objectives. Move up equal to half your roll, rounded down. |
| Provide Help | Ignore your roll. Choose an ally who has not acted this round to form a group with. On their action, you may provide Help to increase their roll. |
| Perform&nbsp;a Combo | **[Special Action]** Move up equal to your roll. Then, you and your allies may move down any total amount. Choose an opponent to move down by that same total amount. Allies who move down with you may not act this round. |

---
<!-- _class: rules -->

| Monstrosity Action | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Perform&nbsp;an Attack | Use your roll to perform an Attack against an opponent who has not acted this round. They roll a new value to Defend with. Whoever loses this Contest moves down by the amount they lost by. |
| Perform&nbsp;a Capture | **[Special Action]** Ignore your roll. Choose an opponent at position $0$ to roll a new value to Defend against your Capture Roll with. If they lose, they are unable to act for the rest of the Endeavor. At the end of later rounds, they may attempt to Defend against your Capture Roll again to end this effect early. |

<!-- _class: rules -->

| Monstrosity Button | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Recovery | *Type:* Personal. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it. *Effect:* End your movement, remove this button, and return to your starting position. |
| Revenge | *Type:* Personal. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it. *Effect:* End your movement, remove this button, and immediately use Perform an Attack against an opponent who caused you to move down this round, even if you or the opponent have already acted this round. |
| Defeat | *Type:* Personal. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it. *Effect:* End your movement, remove this button, and you are unable to act for the rest of the Endeavor. |

### GM Guide: Monstrous Stats
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **Stats:** A Monstrosity's has only two Stat Dice, a higher dice (HD) shared between all their strongest Stats and a lower die (LD) shared between all the rest.
- **Defenses:** A Monstrosity also has a starting position (SP) and one or two recovery buttons (RB). For compactness, if a Monstrosity is said to have an RB of $5$, then it enters with a recovery button at $5$ below its starting position. Together, these represent a Monstrosity's defenses, similar to the concept of "hit points" and "shields" used in other games.
- **Offenses:** A Monstrosity has a Capture Roll (CR) value. When a Monstrosity uses Perform a Capture, instead of rolling for the Attack, it automatically rolls its CR value. This provides a more consistent difficulty level. A Monstrosity may also have one or two Abilities that provide additional offensive actions.
- **Resources:** Finally, a Monstrosity may enter the Endeavor with a number of Blessing Dice (B). These are only used by a Monstrosity to provide Help or Spark a roll.

| Trial | Unrelenting | At the end of each round, perform a new roll and use Perform an Attack for each time you've activated a recovery button. |

### GM Guide: Spoils
<!-- _class: guide -->

Like any other important moment in the narrative, you may choose to award your players Blessings for progressing through a milestone or for creative or cooperative gameplay during the Monstrous Endeavor. 

Additionally, at the end of a Monstrous Endeavor, you may permit your players to perform Checks to find items of interest along the "spoils" of their victory. For example, players may look for parts they can reuse when they defeat murderous robots, a clue revealing the location of the mad scientist's hideout when they calm and befriend one of her creations, or so on.

These narratively reflective moments after a Monstrous Endeavor can be a great chance to rebalance the narrative tension while giving your players agency in thinking about where the story goes next.
