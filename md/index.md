## Introduction
<!-- _class: center major -->

### About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light, semi-crunchy TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things; to provide fun, structured challenges; and to use narrative and tactile cues instead of complex sheets and board states.

This book uses color coded pages:

## Making Your First Character
<!-- _class: center major creation -->

### Character Sheets
<!-- _class: rules -->

All characters in this game have a character sheet, which tracks:

- Your identifying information, like your name, age, and pronouns
- The Stat Dice you'll use for each of the Stats your GM has chosen for the campaign
- A description of your Backstory, including your current Lifestyle and Ethic
- A list of Aptitude areas related to your Backstory
- A list of Specializations that grant additional effects to your Aptitudes
- And other descriptive information, like your items and appearance

You can find a blank Character Sheet form at the end of this book.

### Step One ¬∑ Choose Highest Stat
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe the **Stats** used in *Humanity, Blessed*, known collectively as **the H's of Humanity**. Your GM may add an additional Stat as well.

Your first task is to decide **which Stat your character is best at**.

As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. **Why are they good at this and not at that?** Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

When you begin the game, most of your Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Checks. However, the Stat you chose as your **highest Stat begins the game one die size larger**. In Step Two of character creation your **Lifestyle and Ethic** will also increase your starting Stat Dice.

All your Stat Dice may be **upgraded later in the Session Shop**.

### Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

All characters in this game have the following Stats, each related to a different "scope" of action:

| üß† Head Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music, picking locks. *High/Low:* With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. But with a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach. |

| ‚úåÔ∏è Hand Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Athletic pursuits, endurance, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly, pickpocketing. *High/Low:* With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. But with a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way. |

| üíï Heart Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally, creating expressive art, performing sleights of hand for an audience. *High/Low:* With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. But with a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are. |

| ‚òï Home Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Protecting yourself and loved ones, tending to illness and wounds, shopping, crafting, scavenging, camping, cooking, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. *High/Low:* With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. But with a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you seem to always misplace things. |

| üëø Hurt Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. *High/Low:* With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. But with a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies. |

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. *High/Low:* With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. But with a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like. |

| ‚è≥ History Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, and hardships covered by your Backstory, as well as other aspects covered by the history of your people and not covered by your other Stats. *High/Low:* With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialization you set out to achieve. But with a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often. |

### Optional Stats
<!-- _class: ability -->

Your GM may add one of the following Stats to your game, depending on the game's setting and tone:

| ü™∂ Hex Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *Setting:* Magic or fantasy. |

| ü•ï Ham Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *Setting:* Cartoon. |

| üîé Hunch Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *Setting:* Film noir. |

| ü¶æ Hardware Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *Setting:* Cyberpunk. |

| üëæ Hologram Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. *Setting:* Futuristic. |

| üí∞ Hireling Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *Setting:* Absurd capitalist. |

| üéÅ Holly Jolly Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *Setting:* Winter wonderland. |

| üéß Headline Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *Setting:* Battle of the bands. |

| ü¶† Host Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. *Effect:* When you would fail a Check while using this Stat, receive $+2$ in aid. There may be consequences. *Setting:* Alien paranormal suspense. |

| üíÄ Hardship Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. *Effect:* This Stat cannot be only be a $d4$. *Setting:* Suspense horror. |

| üëª Haunted Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. *Effect:* This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, and can only be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d2$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. *Setting:* Poe style. |

| üå≥ Hardy Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Shared narrative elements emerging from each session's obstacles and players' combined efforts against the challenges they've faced. *Effect:* This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d2$. When a player fails a Check, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy Stat Die instead of one of their other Stat Dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d2$. *Setting:* Coming of age. |

| ‚ö´ Haze Stat |
| --- |
| *Scope:* Dark narrative elements representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. *Effect:* This die begins the game as a $d2$ and only changes when the character fails certain Checks against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat Die instead of their own usual die for the roll. *Setting:* Psychological horror. |

### Stat Dice
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each of a character's Stats is represented by a Stat Die.

In general:

- **Die Sizes:** A Stat Die can be one of five sizes, from $d2$ to $d10$, as described in the Stat Dice Notation table below.
- **Stat Dice "Bump":** Stat Dice in this game "bump." This means that when you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again and add the new result to the previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.
- **Skill and Determination:** Success and victory without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination or focus on the action.
- **Balanced Stats:** Stats are "balanced" if they use the same size Stat Die.
- **Unconventional Stats:** Whenever an effect has you use a Stat, you may instead use any other Stat you have balanced with it, referred to as using an "unconventional Stat."
- **History Stat:** You may use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes (described later in this chapter).
- **Sparking:** You may "Spark" two balanced Stats together to create a more powerful effect (described in the Playing the Game chapter).

<div>
  <h4>
    Stat Dice Notation
  </h4>

  | Notation | Stat Die |
  | -------- | -------- |
  | $d10$ | A ten-sided die. The largest die size in the game. |
  | $d8$  | An eight-sided die. |
  | $d6$  | A six-sided die. |
  | $d4$  | A four-sided die. |
  | $d2$  | Any of the above dice, treating any odd number as $1$ and any even number as $2$. The smallest die size in the game. |
</div>

Also note:

- **Bumping Dice Groups:** Some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.
- **Explicit Dice Grouping Only:** Note, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Step Two ¬∑ Choose Lifestyle and Ethic
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe starting **Lifestyle** and **Ethic** options. Lifestyle upgrade options are listed in the **Session Shop** chapter.

As you read the starting Lifestyle and Ethic options, begin to describe the life your character had **growing up** and their **current outlook** on the world.

Then, pick one **Lifestyle** and one **Ethic** to begin the game with. Lifestyles can be changed later in the **Session Shop**. Ethics can only be changed with GM discretion.

Once you've chosen your starter Lifestyle and Ethic, **two of your Stats** will begin the game an additional **die size larger**, according to your starting Lifestyle and Ethic. Consult the Lifestyle/Ethic Starting Stats table below to know which Stats to increase.

<div>
  <h4>
    Lifestyle/Ethic Starting Stats
  </h4>
  <table>
      <thead>
          <tr>
          <td></td>
          <th scope="col">Vice &amp; Virtue</th>
          <th scope="col">Fate &amp; Knowledge</th>
          <th scope="col">Cunning &amp; Capability</th>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
          <tr> <th scope="row">Carefree</th> <td>Heart and Hurry</td> <td>Head and Hurt</td> <td>Hand and Home</td> </tr>
          <tr> <th scope="row">Eager</th> <td>Hand and Hurt</td> <td>Heart and Home</td> <td>Head and Hurry</td> </tr>
          <tr> <th scope="row">Wisened</th> <td>Head and Home</td> <td>Hand and Hurry</td> <td>Heart and Hurt</td> </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Lifestyles
<!-- _class: ability -->

| üçÄ Carefree Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| *Description:* Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your naivete, wealthy upbringing, optimistic demeanor, or (in a darker setting) a nihilistic worldview. |

| üî• Eager Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| *Description:* Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, a person you want to impress, or a mission or faith you believe strongly in. |

| üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened Lifestyle | 
| --- |
| *Description:* Maybe life has not been easy on your character, but if so you've come out wiser and tougher. Perhaps you've been shaped by unfortunate events, you've dedicated yourself to your work, or (in some settings) you could take advantage of others easily because you understand how people work. |

### Ethics
<!-- _class: ability -->

| ‚öîÔ∏è Vice &amp; Virtue Ethic |
| --- |
| *Description:* Deep down, you may believe that there is good in the world and that no matter how terrible the world gets, the people who are good will win in the end. You may also believe that people who live with virtue are able to live in harmony together, while excess vice manifests itself as a clear and knowable "darkness." |

| üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge Ethic |
| --- |
| *Description:* What drives your actions may be a firm belief that your personal traits dictate your destiny, not whether you are "good," and that personal traits can never really be changed. You may also believe that your destiny can be altered to your liking by making the right deal, adhering to the right discipline, or acquiring the right knowledge‚Äîends justify the means after all. |

| ‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability Ethic |
| --- |
| *Description:* At the end of the day, you may believe that the only person you can really trust is yourself. You may also believe that the world is unfair, "good" and "fate" are made up ideas, and you'd do whatever it takes to just get by. |

### Setting Ethic
<!-- _class: rules -->

The game's setting shapes its events, characters, and places, as well as the consequences of rolling very high or very low. The setting also has an Ethic of its own, which shapes its tone, what it means to be "Carefree," "Eager," or "Wisened" in the setting, and a number of game rules or options.

- **‚öîÔ∏è Vice &amp; Virtue:** This Setting Ethic likely the most familiar, especially for good vs. evil stories. *Genre:* high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories.  *Typical Lifestyle Upgrades:* Blossomed, Driven, Steadfast.
- **üåí Fate &amp; Knowledge:** This Setting Ethic resists feeling familiar, as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. *Genre:* dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror. *Typical Lifestyle Upgrades:* Prodigious, Chosen, Warry.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Cunning &amp; Capability:** This Setting Ethic is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without a clear good vs. evil component. *Genre:* cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories. *Typical Lifestyle Upgrades:* Crafty, Wired, Compelling.

### Step Three ¬∑ Describe Backstory
<!-- _class: creation -->

Begin to describe your character's story before, coming into, and outside of the game's main story. **Answer the following prompts** or others given to you by your GM.

These background details will help you and your GM build the story and set your **Backstory**, which is used by your **History Stat** and **Aptitudes** (described lated in this chapter).

For now:

- Describe **who your character looks up to**, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on.
- List **three specific skills** that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
- List **three specific people or groups** that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
- Describe **where your character could be found** on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
- If your game's setting has **non-human characters** and your character is one of them, work with your GM to determine how your non-human background affects your Backstory or the scope of your Stats.

And as you play, **keep notes**! These can help you reflect on you and your group's shared "Group History," as well as your **character's relationship to the Group History**. Maybe not everyone in the party is enthused about the items the party stole last time!

Such reflection can help you **shape the course** of your Backstory and your character's development over the duration of the story, **make important character choices** during your sessions, and **inspire you and your GM** for ideas for future scenes and sessions.

### Backstory
<!-- _class: rules -->

Each character has a Backstory, a list  or description of narrative elements from their background that help define the scope of their History Stat, connect them to other characters and events in the story, and set the stage for their Aptitudes and Specializations.

What makes up a Backstory is determined by the players and the GM working together to craft the seeds for a good story. However, in general:

- **Unique:** Your Backstory should define unique skills, connections, events, traits, and other narrative elements that your character brings to the story.
- **Variety:** Your Backstory should have enough variety that not all or most of your Backstory would already be covered by a single Stat.
- **History Stat:** You may always choose to use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes (described later in this chapter).

### Non-Human Characters
<!-- _class: rules -->

If your game's setting allows you to play non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent it.

The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds among players:

- **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's Backstory to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their background could perform unaided that humans couldn't.
- **Low Variety:** If the player characters come from just a few non-human backgrounds, the GM may expand the scope of two or three Stats to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that humans couldn't.

### Step Four ¬∑ Choose Aptitudes
<!-- _class: creation -->

The following pages describe rules for **Aptitudes** and **Specializations**. You won't begin the game with Specializations, but you will begin the game with a number of Aptitudes drawn from your Backstory.

To help you select your starting Aptitudes, begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. **Have you seen characters like them before** in movies, TV shows, books, or video games? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

Then with that in mind **select two** areas from your Backstory to begin the game "apt" in. For example: Tying Knots (for a scout), Swordfighting (for a knight), Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn), Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician), Acting (for a theater kid), Manipulating Technology (for a hacker), Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer), Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the empire), Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the empire).

If you begin the game with a Stat Die of size $d8$, **select a third** area to begin the game apt in as well.

You may also become apt in additional areas or further **specialize** your apt areas in the **Session Shop** later. Specalizations will grant you **customized effects**.

### Aptitudes and Specializations
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters in this game may have a number of unique effects based on their Aptitudes and Specializations, described below. The Session Shop chapter lists sample Specializations, which refer to rules described in the Playing the Game chapter. However, for now you should know:

- **Aptitudes:** Your Aptitudes are the important and often unique narrative areas you are "apt" in.
- **Aptitude Aid:** When you would fail a Check related enough to your Aptitudes, receive $+2$ in aid.
- **History Stat:** You may always choose to use your History Stat in place of another Stat when the action or effect is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes.
- **Specializations:** Your Specializations are the Aptitudes you have "specialized," which grant you unique effects depending on the nature of the specialization.
- **Specializing an Aptitude:** You may specialize your Aptitudes in the Session Shop. An example is given below.
- **Specialization Limits:** You may not specialize the same Aptitude more than once or choose the same Specialization more than once.

<div>
  <p>
    Example specialization:
  </p>

  1. **Starting Aptitude:** Dave is a rookie cop. During his time in training, he became apt at Obstacles Courses.
  2. **Choosing Specialization:** Then over the course of the story, he specialized his Obstacles Course Aptitude further, with an interest in taking the Friendly Specialization. 
  3. **Explaining Specialization:** Dave's player explains how Dave has a close relationship with his sneakers, which should be able to grant him bonuses on his Checks beyond just running through Obstacle Courses, due to the storied history he shares with his shoes and the power of their bond.
  4. **Customizing Specialization:** The GM agrees, and adjusts the Friendly Specialization to fit the setting and the new Backstory elements about Dave and his sneakers. The GM specifies how much aid Dave's "sneaker companion" provides to which Stats and adds this customized effect to Dave's character sheet.
  5. **Shared Storytelling:** Finally, the GM and Dave's player chat further about the flavor of this Specialization to help the GM prepare for the next session.
</div>

### Finishing Touches ¬∑ Items and Appearance
<!-- _class: creation -->

Finally, **describe your character's appearance** and list **three or four items** your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you begin the game with.

You'll track a list of items that you typically carry with you, and other items you may have can be **determined in the moment**: Over the course of the story, you may perform Checks to **find** new items, **create** new items, **purchase and sell** items, and even see if you **already have** items that could be narratively reasonable for you to have.

And while most items are narrative, some **higher quality items** you acquire along the way may provide aid or effects similar to some Specializations.

If you don't begin the game with a Stat Die of size $d8$, **choose one item** to begin the game at a higher quality so that it provides a "receive $+1$ in aid" effect.

## Playing the Game
<!-- _class: center major rules -->

### Checks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Most situations in this game can be resolved by performing a Check.

To perform a Check:

1. **GM Discretion:** The GM will let you know which Stat is normally associated with the action and if the action will be easier or harder than normal, as described in the Easy and Hard Checks table below.
2. **Choose Stat:** Choose a Stat to roll. Your options are the Stat normally associated with the action, any Stat you have balanced with that Stat, or History if the action is related enough to your Backstory or Aptitudes.
3. **Roll:** Roll your Stat Die for the chosen Stat.
4. **Outcome:** The higher you roll, the greater your degree of success, as described in the Check Outcomes table below.
5. **Boons and Busts:** Some successes grant you additional benefits, called "boons," while others are accompanied by complications, called "busts." If you get a boon and a bust on the same Check, they do not cancel each other out, but lead to a more nuanced result.

<div>
  <h4>
    Check Outcomes
  </h4>

  | Roll | Outcome |
  | ---- | ------- |
  | $4$ or less | Failure |
  | $5$, $6$, or $7$ | Minor Success: Check succeeds, with a bust. |
  | $8$, $9$, or $10$ | Medium Success: Check succeeds. |
  | $11-19$ | Major Success: Check succeeds, with a boon. The higher the roll, the greater the boon. |
  | $20+$ | Maximum Success: Check succeeds with an exceptional boon. |
</div>

<div>
  <h4>
    Easy and Hard Checks
  </h4>

  | Difficulty | Effect |
  | ---------- | ------ |
  | Easy | Receive $+2$ in aid. |
  | Normal | *No effect.* |
  | Hard | Perform the Check twice. If either fails, the whole Check fails. Boons and busts stack. |
  | Complex | Perform the Check several times, at GM discretion. May require a mix of Stats or characters working together. If more than half fail, the whole Check fails. Boons and busts stack. |
</div>

### Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Attacks are similar to Checks, but performed against another character. There are two types of Attacks: violent and non-violent.

- **Violent Attack:** A violent Attack is when a character performs an action against another character's will using Hurt. All Attacks involving Hurt are potentially dangerous. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.
- **Non-violent Attack:** A non-violent Attack is when a character performs an action against another character's will using any Stat besides Hurt.

To perform an Attack:

1. **Attack Stat:** The Attacker chooses if their Attack is violent or non-violent and selects the appropriate Stat for it.
2. **Defense Stat:** The Defender chooses a Stat for their defense, according to the Attack and Defense Stats table below.
3. **Difficulty:** If the Defense Stat Die is larger than the Attack Stat Die, or if there are more Defenders than Attackers, then the Check below is Hard. If the reverse is true, then the Check is Easy. If the Attack is a combination of actions, then the Check is Complex. Items and situations may also affect the Check difficulty.
4. **Attack:** The Attacker performs the Check with their chosen Stat to determine success.

<div>
  <h4>
    Attack and Defense Stats
  </h4>

  | Attack Stat | Defense Stat |
  | -------------- | -------------- |
  | Hurt | <ul><li>Hurry</li><li>Any Stat balanced with Hurry</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with Hurry</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |
  | Hurry | <ul><li>Hurt</li><li>Any Stat balanced with Hurt</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with Hurt</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |
  | History | <ul><li>GM decides</li></ul> |
  | Anything else | <ul><li>Same Stat as Attacker</li><li>Any Stat balanced with that Stat</li><li>Spark two Stats balanced with that Stat</li><li>History (if related enough)</li></ul> |
</div>

### Delayed Attacks
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes Attacks are made that are Defended against at a later time, such as setting traps or sending letters.

Such delayed Attacks are performed as usual with the following adjustments:

- **Trigger:** The Attacker determines their Attack Stat, decribes what condition would activate the Attack, and writes these both down.
- **Defend:** When the Attack is activated, the Defender performs the Check instead of the Attacker as normal. 
- **Difficulty:** If the Defender's Defense Stat Die is larger than the Attacker's Attack Stat Die, then the Check is Easy. If the reverse is true, then the Check is Hard.

### Blessings
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some effects cost "Blessing Dice," or simply "Blessings."

In general:

- **Pool of Blessings:** You have a pool of Blessings, representing resources you can draw upon when the moment calls.
- **Gaining Blessings:** The GM will award Blessings for good role play, creativity, and special achievements, according to the Blessings Opportunities table below and the game's Setting Ethic or your own (at DM discretion). When you gain a Blessing, roll a $d6$ and add that die to your pool of Blessings.
- **Spending Blessings:** When you spend a Blessing, remove it from your pool of Blessings. An effect may require you to spend a Blessing of at least a certain size or multiple Blessings at the same time. The Blessings Notation table below provides examples of how these are notated.
- **Blessings Bump:** Like your Stat Dice, Blessings also bump, but in a slightly different way. When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing.
- **Gain One at a Time:** If you gain multiple Blessings from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

### Helping
<!-- _class: rules -->

Characters may spend their Blessings to Help one another succeed Checks.

To provide Help:

1. **Pay Help Cost:** Once per roll you may Help another character by spending ‚ë†.
2. **Help Bonus:** Add half the value of the spent Blessing to the roll, rounded down, to a minimum of $1$.
3. **Help Bust:** Teamwork makes the dream work, but it also increases the complexity of the situation. Regardless of the result of the roll, it gains an additional bust.

Also note:

- **Help on Hard or Complex Checks:** If you Help a Check that requires multiple rolls, only the lowest of those rolls is Helped.
- **Multiple Helpers:** Multiple characters can Help the same roll if they each pay the cost.
- **Help within Reason:** You cannot Help if you are engaged in another action or if it would be unreasonable.
- **Help as Group:** Providing and receiving Help is considered acting as a group.

### Receiving Situational Aid
<!-- _class: rules -->

While you and your allies may spend Blessings to attempt to Help one another, your Aptitudes and other effects, items, environments, careful planning, or so on can provide you "situational aid."

- **Receive Aid:** Situational aid effects describe a possible failed Check and say to "receive $+X$ in aid" in response. When you do, you gain a $+X$ bonus to the roll, possibly turning the failure into a success.

Also note:

- **One Aid at a Time:** You may only receive situational aid once per roll. If multiple effects would provide situational aid during the same roll, you choose which one to use.

### Spark Rolls
<!-- _class: rules -->

A pair of balanced Stats and can be "Sparked." Sparks are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible, limited only by their imagination&mdash;and ability to control it!

In general, Spark rolls work by grouping Stat Dice and rolling them, increasing the odds of bumping. To perform a Spark roll:

1. **Spark a Roll:** Before rolling, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to instead combine and roll the dice of two balanced Stats as a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two Stats that use a $d6$.
2. **Apply Usual Effects:** Effects that apply to either of the Stats used in the Spark roll also apply to the Spark roll itself.

Alternatively, you can upgrade an existing roll into a Spark roll:

1. **Roll Normally:** Roll the first Stat Die as usual.
2. **Upgrade to Spark:** Then, you may spend ‚äú‚äú to add a second Stat Die to the roll that is balanced with the first. Roll the second Stat Die, add the result to the first, and if the second one bumps, both bump as a group.

The second approach rolls lower on average, but doesn't require you to commit to the cost up front.

Also note:

- **Sparking Hard or Complex Checks:** If you Spark a Check that requires multiple rolls, you choose which roll to Spark.

### Recharge
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some effects list a recharge Blessing cost. Once activated, these effects cannot be activated again until they have been recharged by paying that cost.

### Overcharged Stats
<!-- _class: rules -->

Lifestyle upgrade options overcharge one or two of a character's Stats, which provides situational aid.

- **Overcharged:** When you would fail a Check while performing a Spark roll using an overcharged Stat, receive $+X$ in aid, where $X$ is half the size of the die used in the Spark roll.

### General Endeavor Rules
<!-- _class: rules -->

Sometimes, the player characters will need to race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on! Many such scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

There are several different types of Endeavors depending on the scenario. However, all Endeavors build on these same general rules:

- **Rounds:** Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents.
- **Position Roll:** At the start of each round, choose a Stat to roll to get yourself in position for the actions you plan to take this round. The narrative for your action does not have to be fully formed, just what Stat to use. The GM may limit which Stats you can choose from in certain situations.
- **Temporary Blessings:** Gain a number of temporary Blessings equal to half your position roll, rounded down. Any remaining temporary Blessings disappear at the end of the Endeavor.
- **Turn Order:** Turn order follows the number of temporary Blessings, lowest to highest, with the GM resolving ties.

<!--  -->

- **Actions:** Each round during your turn, choose and perform one action from the set of actions available for that Endeavor. Some actions use your position roll, some ignore it, and some cost Blessings. The GM may limit the actions you can choose from in certain situations. You may also activate effects from your items, specializations, and so on as normal.
- **Special Actions:** Some actions have the `Special Action` label. Special actions cannot be used during the round. Instead, at the end of the round after all normal actions are complete, whoever has the highest number of Blessings chooses a special action to perform, with the GM resolving ties.
- **Movement:** Endeavors use "tracks" to record character positions, scores, progress towards goals, or so on. Tracks begin at $0$ and go up by whole numbers as high as needed. The Endeavor's setup instructions will describe its tracks.
- **Group Movement:** If a group moves together an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.
- **Buttons:** Endeavors add a number of buttons to the track. There are two types of buttons, personal and global. Personal buttons can only be activated by the character associated with them, whereas global buttons can be activated by any character. If an Endeavor uses buttons, it will describe how each is activated and the effect that happens as a result. Additional, some buttons have a passive effect that applies while the button is present.

<div>
  <p>
    Also note:
  </p>

  - **Increasing Rolls:** Before you use your position roll as part of an action, you may receive Help and Spark as usual to increase its value, but this will not give you more temporary Blessings. 
  - **Shifting Turn Order:** If your number of temporary Blessings increases or decreases before you take your turn, the turn order may change so that whoever has not acted yet and has the least temporary Blessings goes next.
</div>

### üßü Monstrous Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

TODO rework

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

- **Setup:** You and your allies begin at position $1$. Your opponents begin higher up, each add defeat buttons at position $0$, and each add recovery buttons somewhere else. Stronger opponents begin further from $0$, may have Abilities, and may enter the Endeavor with Blessings of their own.
- **Goal:** To win, move all your opponents to position $0$ to remove them from the Endeavor. However, if the Monstrosities put three wound buttons in a row on your track they'll remove you from the Endeavor first!
- **Actions:** The actions available are described in the Allied Actions and Monstrosity Actions table below. Some Monstrosity's Abilities grant them additional actions.
- **Movement:** You and your allies care about movement along the tracks. Movement for you and your allies represents "cool points" that your side can use to perform large combos. Movement for your opponents represents their remaining stamina.
- **Buttons:** Your opponents care about buttons on the tracks, described in the Monstrosity Buttons table below. They may enter the Endeavor with a number of Recovery buttons on their own tracks, and they will attempt to add Wound buttons to yours. Some opponents have additional "traits" that change the effects of their Recovery buttons.
- **Tracks:** Though it varies, most Monstrous Endeavors have three types of tracks: melee, ranged, and retreat. You can move from melee to ranged, from ranged to melee or retreat, or retreat back to ranged. If you remain in retreat long enough without an opposing character there, you successfully flee. Otherwise, when an opposing character enters your retreat track, it becomes a new melee track and the retreat effort must begin again.

<div>
  <h4>
    Allied Actions
  </h4>

  | Action | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- |
  | Group Up | *Cost:* ‚ë†. *Effect:* Ignore your position roll. Choose an ally who has not acted this round. You form a group with them. Until the end of the round, you move with them and may provide them Help. |

  | Retreat | *Cost:* ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë†. *Effect:* Move from ranged to retreat. In you remain in retreat until the end of the next round, you may flee the Endeavor. |
  | Interfere | *Cost:* ‚ë† $\times X$. *Effect:* Ignore your position roll. Choose a nearby opponent to lose $X$ Blessings. |
  | Perform&nbsp;a Combo | `Special Action` Move up by your position roll. Then you and your allies may move down any total amount. Choose opponents to move down by that same total amount. |

  <h4>
    Monstrosity Actions
  </h4>

  | Action | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- |
  | Perform&nbsp;an Attack | Use your position roll to Attack an opponent who has not acted this round. They roll a new value and Defend with it. If they lose this Contest, they move down by the amount they lost by. Then if they are at position $0$, they gain a wound button at the first position above them without one already. |
  | Get&nbsp;in Position | Gain a number of temporary Blessings equal to half your position roll, rounded down. Then, if applicable for the Endeavor, use these to perform a Luck Check to change tracks. Any remaining temporary Blessings disappear at the end of next round. |
  | Group Up | Ignore your position roll. Choose an ally who has not acted this round. You form a group with them. Until the end of the round, you move with them and may provide them Help. |
  | Inflict Wounds | `Special Action` Choose an opponent, then any number of additional opponents with a position roll less than your Capture Roll. They each gain a wound button at the first position above them without one already, then any with three or more wounds are "taken down" and may not act the rest of the Endeavor. |
</div>

<div>
  <h4>
    Monstrosity Buttons
  </h4>

  | Button | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- |
  | Recovery | *Type:* Personal. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it. *Effect:* End your movement, remove this button, and return to your starting position. Then if you have the Zealous trait, use your position roll to Attack an opponent who caused you to move down this round, even if you have already acted this round. Then at the end of each round, if you have the Unrelenting trait, for each time you've activated a Recovery button, you may use your position roll to Attack an opponent even if you have already acted this round. *Passive:* If you have the Horde trait, each time you roll, roll an additional time and ignore the lowest value. If you have the Immunity trait, Attacks against you related enough to your Aptitudes automatically fail. |
  | Wound | *Type:* Personal. *Activation:* Activate this button when you move over it while moving up. *Effect:* Decrease your remaining movement by $1$, to a minimum of $0$. |
</div>

### GM Guide ¬∑ Monstrosities
<!-- _class: guide -->

- **Stat Dice:** A Monstrosity has a highest die (HD) shared between all their strongest Stats and lower dice one or two die sizes smaller for all the rest.
- **Defenses:** A Monstrosity also has a starting position (SP) and one or two recovery buttons. For compactness, for example, if a Monstrosity is said to have an SP of $10 (3)$, then it enters at position $10$ and has a recovery button $3$ below that starting position. If it has an SP of $30 (10, 15)$, then it enters at position $30$ and has recovery buttons at $10$ and $15$ below that starting position. Together, a Monstrosity's SP and recovery buttons represent its defenses, similar to the concept of "hit points" and "shields" used in other games.
- **Offenses:** A Monstrosity has a Capture Roll (CR) value used when it performs Inflict Wounds. This provides more consistent difficulty levels for Endeavors. A Monstrosity may also have one or two Abilities that provide additional offensive actions.
- **Resources:** Finally, a Monstrosity may enter the Endeavor with a number of Blessings (B). These are only used by a Monstrosity to provide Help or Spark a roll.
- **Experience:** In games with experience points (XP), a Monstrosity contributes an amount of XP toward Endeavor rewards when it is defeated. Track the highest XP the party has earned from any Endeavor, and when they reach a new XP record, award the party a total number of Blessings equal to the amount the XP record increased by. 
- **Building Monstrous Endeavors:** To build memorable, balanced, and challenging Monstrous Endeavors, include two or three different types of Monstrosities per Endeavor, at various tiers of difficulty and/or with different types of abilities. Also, being outnumbered *quickly* increases the difficulty and complexity, even if most of the Monstrosities are very weak! To help manage this complexity, give a lay of the land describing the different types of tracks the Endeavor starts with and how they relate.
- **Building Monstrosities:** The following Monstrosity Stats and Monstrosity Ability tables provide a starting point for creating Monstrosities at different tiers of difficulty:

<div>
  <h4>
    Monstrosity Stats
  </h4>

  | Difficulty | HD | SP | CR | B | XP |
  | ---------- | -- | -- | -- | - | -- |
  | Trivial | $d4$ | $5-10 (5-10)$ | $4$ | $0$ | $1-6$ |
  | Easy | $d6$ | $10-15 (5-15)$ | $4$ | $0$ | $7-12$ |
  | Medium | $d6$ | $15-20 (5-15)$ | $6$ | $0$ | $13-18$ |
  | Hard | $d8$ | $20-25 (5-15)$ | $6$ | $3$ | $19-24$ |
  | Severe | $d8$ | $20-30 (15-20)$ | $8$ | $3$ | $25-30$ |
  | Trial | $d10$ | $20-30 (5-10, 15-20)$ | $8$ | $5$ | $31+$ |
</div>

### Conditions
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on, beyond mere injury. When these happen, you may become Disarmed, Surprised, Uncool, or any of the other Conditions described in the Condition Effects table below.

In general however:

- **Conditions Tell Stories:** At minimum, Conditions provide effects. However, they also represent small story arcs where you face obstacles and, in spite of the Condition's effects, overcome those obstacles. When you fail a Check and gain a Condition as a result, consider how your character feels about the situation and what the Condition means to them beyond mere effect.
- **Conditions Build Connections:** Gaining and removing Conditions, and facing and overcoming obstacles, happen with other characters around. Consider, and take notes for the development of your character: Who else is around that saw the failed Check happen? How would your Hero feel about the failure? And how could your connections to other characters help you remove the Condition later?

<div>
  <h4>
    Condition Effects
  </h4>

  | Condition | Description |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | Ache | *Effect:* Rolls you make with the affected Stat cannot bump. *Duration:* Until next scene. |

  | Surprised | *Effect:* Your rolls cannot bump, Spark, or use an unconventional Stat. *Duration:* Until next roll. |
