### GM Guide ¬∑ Large-Scale Endeavors
<!-- _class: guide -->

Resolving actions that occur on massive scales&mdash;such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster&mdash;requires shifting the scale of the narrative.

This may be done in an Endeavor by spending one round at the large-scale action before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them for the next several rounds.

The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

### üõ°Ô∏è Clash Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters summoning, rallying, or inspiring allies to face off against an opposing side's summoned, rallied, or inspired allies&mdash;such as soldiers in your command, athletes you are coaching, creature companions you have befriended, knights dueling as your champions, spirits you are channeling, or spectral monsters you've summoned by playing music so well!

- **Setup:** You, your allies, and your opponents do not have a position. Instead, both sides begin the Endeavor with two "summons" on their side at position $1$. A "summon" is a character or other entity you have summoned to your side for the Endeavor, and a "summoner" is any character or group summoning others to their side. Generally a summon is considered to have existed before they were summoned to your side&mdash;"being summoned" just places them into the game's evolving story.
- **Goal:** You win when your summons have captured enough opposing summons.
