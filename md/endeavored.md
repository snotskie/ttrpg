### Using d20s
<!-- _class: guide -->

*Humanity, Blessed* only uses dice of size $d2$ through $d10$. However, sometimes you may want to use a $d20$ instead. Perhaps you've collected a fun set of $d20$s, you're controlling many characters at once, or you don't want to reveal NPC Stat Dice sizes.

Whatever the case, you may use the $d20$ Conversion table below to approximate this game's dice. Note how $d20$ values are converted for the $d6$ and $d8$, which allow it to behave within about 5% of those dice.

## Endeavors
<!-- _class: center major rules -->

### ‚è© Rush Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some scenes call for something between a Monstrous Endeavor and a Racing Endeavor, where the player characters must charge in and stop the enemy before they complete their plans, such as catching a thief before they can escape with a powerful artifact or infiltrating a star base before it can fire a large laser.

<div>

These can be performed like a Monstrous Endeavor, with the following adjustments:

- **Goal:** Move all your opponents to position $0$ before they can complete their scheme or foil your plans.
- **Charge Leader:** Before the first round, elect a "charge leader" from among you and your allies. Only the charge leader and the opponents are considered for determining who takes special actions.
- **Foiling:** When a charge leader is "foiled," another ally becomes the charge leader instead. Once you are foiled, you cannot become the charge leader again. Your opponents do not automatically win if your entire side has been foiled, but your victory will be much more difficult.
- **Simpler Turn Order:** Turn order moves clockwise, with the charge leader acting first, and it is never reversed. If there is no charge leader, monstrosities act first.
- **As Usual:** Actions, ally special actions, and buttons&mdash;these are as usual for a Monstrous Endeavor. However, monstrosities use the following special actions instead.

</div>

<div>
  <h4>
    Rush Monstrosity Special Actions
  </h4>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Plot Victory</th>
        <td><code>Special Action</code> Spend all your temporary Blessings and foil the charge leader. Then for each Recovery button your side has activated, add a Scheme button at the first position at or above your current position without one already.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Declare Victory</th>
        <td><code>Special Action</code> If there are 10 or more Scheme buttons in a row, spend all your temporary Blessings and remove all opponents from the Endeavor.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### üí£ Stealth Endeavors
<!-- _class: rules -->

Some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

<div>

These are performed like any other Endeavor, with the following adjustments, action options, and buttons:

- **Efficiency and Progress:** The symbol <b>X</b> represents your "efficiency" for the round, such as efficiency at stealth, charisma, or so on. And your temporary blessings represent your accumulated "progress" towards your plan.
- **The Eye:** The opposing side is represented by the "Eye." When the Endeavor begins, the Eye is in "warry mode," on the lookout for you and your fellow "rogues." However, once the Eye has been alerted, it will enter the much more dangerous "wake mode." For the sake of rules, the Eye is a character, but it has only a single Watch Stat, has no track position, it cannot be Attacked directly, and its Watch Stat is never spent when chosen as its Action Die.
- **Setup:** You and your fellow rogues begin at position $1$. At the top of the first round, the lay of the land will be provided at table discretion for the guarded area, including any rooms, halls, obstacles to climb or hide behind, locking and security mechanisms, and so on. The Eye's defenses in those areas are represented by Alarm buttons, actions the rogues need to complete are represented by Objective buttons, exit points are represented by Escape buttons, and places safe from danger are represented by Sanctuary buttons. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own track and lay of the land.
- **Goal:** Remove all Objective buttons without alerting the Eye.
