***Humanity, Blessed* ⊜**, is a rules-light, semi-crunchy TTRPG system. It is inspired by our favorite stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things. This system is designed to provide fun, structured challenges and to use narrative and tactile cues instead of complex sheets and board states.
