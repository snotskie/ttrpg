*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light, semi-crunchy TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, books, and TV. *Humanity, Blessed* is designed to tell stories about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things; to provide fun, structured challenges; and to use narrative and tactile cues instead of complex sheets and board states.
