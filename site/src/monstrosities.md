# Endeavor Monstrosities

## What is a Monstrosity?

A Monstrosity does not have a set of Stats or Abilities in the same way any other character would. While a Monstrosity is a "character" for the sake of wording in rules, Monstrosities feel somehow different, strange, more powerful, just "off," or so on compared to non-Monstrous things. And mechanically they reflect this.

Even a non-Monstrous non-player character, once it becomes a Monstrosity for the sake of a Monstrous Endeavor, changes. This is to reflect that *thing* that makes Monstrosities narratively interesting in your setting.

So when you create Monstrosities, take time to thing about what it means to be "Monstrous" in your setting, and then use Monstrous Endeavors as a way to play with that idea over a period of sustained tension.

If your players are facing off against other non-Monstrous characters, then reflect that by using a non-Monstrous Endeavor.

Reserve Monstrous Endeavors for encounters that are truly Monstrous.

## Monstrous Stats

Instead of a number of Stat dice, a Monstrosity has a single die shared by all their Stats. And to allow a finer gradient of "weak" to "strong" Monstrosities, their Stat dice can be "capped" at smaller values.

For example, the notation $dc2$ represents a $d4$ that has been capped at the value $2$: If the die were to roll a value greater than $2$, it rolls a $2$ instead. Put another way, this represents a single die with four sides, $1$, $2$, $2$, and $2$. This is the smallest possible capped die.

In general, the notation $dcX$ represents the smallest standard die in this game ($d4$, $d6$, $d8$, or $d10$) capable of rolling $X$, capped so that it cannot roll higher than $X$. In this notation, $dc4$ just is a $d4$, and so on.

## Stronger Monstrosities

The die cap $dc10$ is the strongest die cap a Monstrosity can have, and the player characters will, in just a few sessions, catch up to this point.

For higher level Endeavors, you may give your Monstrosities Abilities, choosing from the list below or creating your own.

Additionally, you may have your Monstrosities enter Endeavors with a number of Blessings.

## Monstrous Abilities

Monstrosities can Help and Super-Help just as other characters. However, they cannot perform Preparedness Checks. You may also give your Monstrosities any of the following Monstrous Abilities or create your own. These Abilities are listed in a rough order from "weakest" to "strongest."

It is also recommended that you do not give your Monstrosities many Abilities--one or two well-placed Abilities are plenty to make a Monstrosity memorable! Consider adding multiple Monstrosities to a Monstrous Endeavor that have complementary skills to create sessions that feel engaging and strategic. And for Monstrosities that use "magic" or wield some other kind of powerful force, we recommend using the Spark Rush $X$ Ability, flavoring it for the occasion.

**Resistance vs. $X$:** Whenever you lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Revenge:** When you are Muddled, you may immediately perform a Contest as an Attacker against the character that Muddled you, as though this Contest were a Side Action.

**Shield vs. $X$:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Resistance vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ② to recharge it.

**Tap:** When you succeed a Hand Contest against an opponent during an Endeavor, you may have that opponent move backwards a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Debilitate $X$:** Perform a $X$ Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, that opponent’s $X$ rolls are made with a $-1$ modifier for that many rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ② to recharge it.

**Clarity:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have the muddle buttons of your allies move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Immunity vs. $X$:** Whenever you lose a Contest as the Defender against $X$, you instead succeed by $1$.

**Inspire:** Perform a Hurry Check and choose an ally. The amount you move forward as a result of this Check, the roll the chosen ally makes next round to take the focus increases by that amount. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ④ to recharge it.

**Mirror vs. $X$:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies receive Immunity vs. $X$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ⑥ to recharge it.

**Spark Rush $X$:** Perform a Check. The amount you move forward as a result of this Check, for that many rounds, to a maximum of $3$ rounds, you may Spark using $2dcX$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend Ⓧ to recharge it.

**Empower:** When you succeed a Home Stat Check during an Endeavor, you may have you and your allies increase their die caps by $1$ for a number of rounds equal to the number of spaces you moved forward as a result of the Check, to a maximum of $3$ rounds. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it. A character can only benefit from one instance of this Ability at a time.

**Cursed Touch:** Perform a Head Contest against an opponent. The amount you move forward as a result of this Contest, the opponent is Cursed by you for that many rounds. (When you see that opponent perform a roll, you may choose to have them reroll it and take the new value, then the Curse ends. Otherwise, the Curse ends when that many rounds have passed.)  Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ③ to recharge it.

**Unrelenting:** At the end of each round, move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.

**Merciless:** At the end of each round, gain a number of Blessings equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.

## Spoils

Characters do not level up or gain experience points for defeating Monstrosities. Instead, like any other important moment in the narrative, you may choose to award your players Blessings for progressing through a milestone or for creative or cooperative gameplay during the Monstrous Endeavor. 

Additionally, at the end of a Monstrous Endeavor, you may permit your players to perform Preparedness Checks without spending a Blessing to find items of interest to them along the "spoils" of their victory. For example, players may look for parts they can reuse when they defeat murderous robots, a clue revealing the location of the mad scientist's hideout when they calm and befriend one of her creations, or so on.

These narratively reflective moments after a Monstrous Endeavor can be a great chance to rebalance the narrative tension while giving your players agency in thinking about where the story goes next.

## Example Monstrosities

The following table shows a variety of example Monstrosity builds. For each, it shows their die cap, how many Blessings they enter Endeavors with, their Stamina, at what position(s) the Monstrosity's muddle buttons are placed, their Abilities (if any), and a brief comment about that build. The purpose of this table is not to provide a compendium of Monstrosities to choose from, but to provide enough examples to give you a sense of mechanically balanced Monstrosities so that you can create memorable, fun Monstrous Encounters of your own.
