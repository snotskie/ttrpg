# Endeavor Monstrosities

## What is a Monstrosity?

A Monstrosity does not have a set of Stats or Abilities in the same way any other character would. While a Monstrosity is a "character" for the sake of wording in rules, Monstrosities feel somehow different, strange, more powerful, just "off," or so on compared to non-Monstrous things. And mechanically they reflect this.

Even a non-Monstrous non-player character, once it becomes a Monstrosity for the sake of a Monstrous Endeavor, changes. This is to reflect that *thing* that makes Monstrosities narratively interesting in your setting.

So when you create Monstrosities, take time to thing about what it means to be "Monstrous" in your setting, and then use Monstrous Endeavors as a way to play with that idea over a period of sustained tension.

If your players are facing off against other non-Monstrous characters, then reflect that by using a non-Monstrous Endeavor.

Reserve Monstrous Endeavors for encounters that are truly Monstrous.

## Monstrous Stats

Instead of a number of Stat dice, a Monstrosity has a single die shared by all their Stats. And to allow a finer gradient of "weak" to "strong" Monstrosities, their Stat dice can be "capped" at smaller values.

For example, the notation $dc2$ represents a $d4$ that has been capped at the value $2$: If the die were to roll a value greater than $2$, it rolls a $2$ instead. Put another way, this represents a single die with four sides, $1$, $2$, $2$, and $2$. This is the smallest possible capped die.

In general, the notation $dcX$ represents the smallest standard die in this game ($d4$, $d6$, $d8$, or $d10$) capable of rolling $X$, capped so that it cannot roll higher than $X$. In this notation, $dc4$ just is a $d4$, and so on.

## Stronger Monstrosities

The die cap $dc10$ is the strongest die cap a Monstrosity can have, and the player characters will, in just a few sessions, catch up to this point.

For higher level Endeavors, you may give your Monstrosities Abilities, choosing from the list below or creating your own.

Additionally, you may have your Monstrosities enter Endeavors with a number of Blessings.

## Monstrous Evergreen Abilities

Monstrosities can Help and Super-Help just as other characters. However, they cannot perform Preparedness Checks.

**Unrelenting:** At the end of each round, move forward a number of spaces equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.

**Merciless:** At the end of each round, gain a number of Blessings equal to the number of times you've been Muddled.
