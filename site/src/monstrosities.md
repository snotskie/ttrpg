# Endeavor Monstrosities

## End Conditions

## Die Caps

To allow a finer gradient of "weak" to "strong" Monstrosities, their Stat dice can be "capped" at smaller values.

For example, the notation $dc2$ represents a $d4$ that has been capped at the value $2$: If the die were to roll a value greater than $2$, it rolls a $2$ instead. Put another way, this represents a single die with four sides, $1$, $2$, $2$, and $2$. This is the smallest possible capped die.

In general, the notation $dcX$ represents the smallest standard die in this game ($d4$, $d6$, $d8$, or $d10$) capable of rolling $X$, capped so that it cannot roll higher than $X$.

## Stronger Monstrosities

The die cap $dc10$ is the strongest die cap a Monstrosity can have, and the player characters will, in just a few sessions, catch up to this point.

For higher level Endeavors, you may give your Monstrosities Abilities, choosing from the list below or creating your own. Additionally, you may have your Monstrosities enter Endeavors with a number of Blessings.
