# Playing the Game

## Special Rules about Dice in *Humanity, Blessed*

There are two special rules to know about dice in this game: dice "bump," meaning they are rerolled when they roll a $1$, and some dice are "capped," meaning if they would roll a number higher than their cap, they roll the cap instead.

### Bumping Dice

Dice in this game “bump.”

When you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Succeeding on a Check or winning a Contest without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination and focus on the action.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group of Dice"
    In this game, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Capped Dice

Some rules in this game refer to "capped" dice--those related to Helping and Monstrosities. These dice are the standard dice of the game ($d4$ through $d10$), but "capped" at smaller values.

For example, the notation $dc2$ represents a $d4$ that has been capped at the value $2$: If the die were to roll a value greater than $2$, it rolls a $2$ instead. Put another way, this represents a single die with four sides, $1$, $2$, $2$, and $2$. This is the smallest possible capped die, as well as the most commonly used.

In general, the notation $dcX$ represents the smallest standard die in this game capable of rolling $X$, capped so that it cannot roll higher than $X$. In this notation, $dc4$ just is a $d4$, and so on. And as a special case, the notation $dc1$ is simply a die that always rolls $1$ and cannot bump.

!!! details "DM Note: Bumping Die Statistics"
    If you need to estimate the average result of a roll of a die that bumps, follow this process.

    Let $a$ be the average value of the die if it *doesn't* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means the average when not rolling a $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

    Let $b$ be the average value if the die if it *does* roll a number that bumps. Normally this means just the value $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

    Let $c$ be the number of values on the die that *don't* cause it to bump. Normally this means one less than the size of the die, but some Abilities modify this.

    Let $k$ be the number of values on the die that *do* cause it to bump. Normally this means just $1$, but some Abilities modify this.

    Then, the average value of rolling the die would be:

    $a + \frac{bk}{c}$

    For example:
    
    - the average of a $dc2$ is $2 + \frac{1}{3}$
    - the average of a $d6$ with the Focused Determination Ability is $4 + \frac{2}{5}$

## Your Dice

You play this game with three sets of dice:

- Your Stat Dice, representing your general capabilities. You will likely need $2d4$, $2d6$, $2d8$, and $2d10$ over the course of the game 
- Your pool of Blessing Dice, which are spent to activate different Abilities. Your DM will likely provide this, either as a pool of several small $d6$ or as a deck of cards only containing several copies of the numbers $1$ through $6$
- Any special dice used within the rules of your Abilities, if any. You may use your same Stat Dice, or carry a few extra dice as used by your Abilities. Most common is a $dc2$, so a few extra $d4$ will likely do the trick

## Blessing Dice

Characters in this game each have a pool of Blessing Dice, representing a pool of resources they can draw upon to recharge their abilities and help their friends.

The DM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements.

When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice. And, like your Stat Dice, your Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way.

When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Blessing Dice do not Group"
    If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

!!! details "DM Note: When to Award Blessing Dice"
    You as a DM should award players Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters’ abilities depend on them.

    What this looks like can vary per DM, per table, or per scene.

    Some DMs may prefer an approach where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer an approach where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

    The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a DM in this game! Use it well!

    All this being said, we recommend new DMs to this game use the following:

    - Award $3$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such as after the player has introduced their character
    - Award a Blessing Die the first time each session the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $5$ or more, and award each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high win or success a Blessing Dice as well
    - Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions
    - Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session, before modifications to the roll from effects or Abilities. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both dice this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is almost impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game; such sessions take place narratively on an "unlucky day"
    - Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story

### Spending Blessing Dice

Some actions can only be performed by first "spending" some number of dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth some value or more.

The notation ① represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $1$ or more. The notation ② represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $2$ or more. And so on.

The notation ①① represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth $1$ or more. The notation ②② represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth $2$ or more. And so on.

When a Blessing Die is spent, it is removed from your pool of Blessing Dice.

## Actions: Level 1

An "action" is anything you choose for your character to do.

Some actions require you to perform rolls to determine the outcome. The simplest of these are Stat Checks and Contests.

The rules for more complex types of actions build up from there.

### Stat Checks

To perform a Stat Check, roll the die for the action’s associated Stat. The DM will let you know which to use. If the result of the roll meets or beats the DM’s target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Stat Check Targets"
    Use $4$ for an easy Stat Check, $8$ for medium, $12$ for hard, $16$ for very hard, and $20$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. The lowest possible Basic Stat Check is $2$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $1$ to $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $12$ is the lowest Stat Check difficulty where a player can begin to fail bad enough for disastrous results.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Targets for Coming Prepared"
    When setting targets for Home Stat Checks characters perform to see if they already came prepared with just the item they need, consider:

    - How common, niche, specialized, rare, or unique in the world the desired item is
    - How probable it would be to already have that item
    - How many items the character already has listed

    If it would not require much suspension of disbelief for the character to have the item in the scene, use an easy to medium target. Otherwise, use a hard or higher target.
    
    If a player fails a Check this way, you may decide that they can't perform more Checks this way until the end of the scene or session. Moreover, if they fail such a Check by a disastrous amount, perhaps they dropped and broke other items while digging around in their bag, alerted others to their location, or so on.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Targets for Magic"
    If your setting has "magic" or other supernatural, reality-bending player capabilities, the way you set targets for these Checks depends on the nature of "magic" in your setting. 

    We recommend providing your players a table that describes your "magic" targets for them:

    - Each row of the table corresponds to an outcome size, from Very Minor to Maximum
    - Each column corresponds to a "school" of "magic," a type of action, or an aspect of the desired effect such as duration and distance
    - Each cell describes what a "magic" action of that outcome size and category might look like
    - Players and you determine which cells are most like what the player wants to achieve with their "magic," and the highest outcome size among those cells is the outcome size their roll will need to meet, with you having final say on the exact Check target
    - Each row also has a "limit" noted. If an action would meet more than a row's limit worth of cells across that row, then the roll would need to meet one outcome size higher

### Long Actions

A long action is any action that is multi-step, spans a longer period of time than most other actions, and involves the scope of multiple Stats.

For example:

- Formulating a plan for a heist
- Engaging in political intrigue
- Crafting or reparing specialized items
- Navigating and piloting a crewed vessel
- Running a business
- Searching ruins for forbidden knowledge while avoiding bounty hunters' detection

For simplicity, the DM may ask for a single Check or Contest, using only the single Stat that the long action's success or victory most turns on. The target for success or victory without difficulties may be higher than usual in this case.

Alternatively, the DM may ask for three or four Checks or Contests, using the various Stats involved in the long action. For overall success or victory, at least half of these rolls will need to win or succeed. However, each failure or loss may incur difficulties on top of that success.

!!! details "DM Note: Resolving Player-Driven Narrative"
    For even more narratively complex actions, such as the players proposing a course of action that in itself could be a session or campaign arc, you may ask for a set of rolls for multiple Stats in the same way, each corresponding to a different necessary step of their plan. Then, based on the results, you provide different amounts or types of information to set them off on their quest to complete those steps in full over the next several scenes or missions.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Targets for Crafting"
    Crafting new items from one's surroundings, tools, and supplies is a long action, in that it usually requires a number of tasks that span the scope of multiple Stats:

    - Gathering high quality supplies (Home)
    - Gaining knowledge of how to construct the desired object (Head)
    - Gathering or constructing the necessary tools (Hand or Home)
    - Constructing the desired object, which can involve multiple steps depending on the complexity (Hand)
    - Improvising adjustments when tools or supplies break or when one's initial plans were imperfect (Heart)
    - Meddling with the forces of the universe (Hex, Ham, Hologram, etc. for settings that have a Stat for the "magic" of the world)

    So, resolve crafting as you would any other long action. The intended "power" or effect of the item can help determine the target, for example:

    - **Mundane:** Provides narrative function only. Typically requires a Very Minor or Minor outcome
    - **High-Quality Mundane:** Provides a "protect yourself for $+1$" effect. Typically requires a Medium outcome
    - **Powered:** Provides a "protect yourself for $+dc2$" effect. Typically requires a Major or Very Major outcome
    - **Mythic:** Provides narrative fame or infamy in addition to a "protect yourself for $+dc4$" effect. Typically requires a Maximum outcome
    - **Reality-Breaking Artifact:** Drives narrative arc in addition to providing a "protect yourself for $+2dc4$" effect. Typically not possible

    If you use the approach of requiring multiple Checks to resolve the long action, consider adding flaws or limitations to the created item if any of the failed Checks fail by a large amount.
    
    If you instead require only a single, harder Check, then consider allowing success if the player hits the base target, but only avoids flaws and limitations if they hit the harder target.

### Spark Stat Checks

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

You may spend $2$ dice from your pool of Blessing Dice of the same worth to perform a Spark Stat Check instead of a Basic Stat Check, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each. These Spark Stat Checks represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination--and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark Stat Check also apply to the Spark Stat Check itself.

!!! warning "Rules Note: You Can Spark After First Roll"
    You can decide to turn a Basic Stat Check into a Spark Stat Check before or after you've made your first roll for the Check.

    For example, when you roll your first $1$ on the die, you can decide to take extra advantage of this opportunity. If you do, pay the Blessing Die cost to Spark, roll your second die, then reroll both for the bump, and add it all together.

!!! details "DM Note: Spark Statistics"
    *This note continues from the previous statistics note.*

    The equation for finding the average of a Sparked roll is similar to before, but finding the values to plug in takes a few extra steps.

    Let $d$ be the size of the dice used for the Sparked roll.

    Let $n$ be the number of dice used for the Sparked roll. Normally this is just $2$, but some Abilities modify this.

    Let $a_s$ be the average value of the dice if *none* of them rolls a value that would bump: $a_s = n a$.

    Let $b_s$ be the average value of the dice if *any* of them rolls a value that would bump: $b_s = b + a \frac{c}{d} + b \frac{k}{d}$

    Let $k_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *any* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $k_s = k^n + n (d-k) k^{n-1}$

    Let $c_s$ be the number of possible rolls where *none* of the dice rolls a value that would bump: $c_s = d^n - k_s$

    Then, the average value of rolling the Sparked dice would be:

    $a_s + \frac{b_s k_s}{c_s}$

### Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character’s will using any Stat besides Hurt. To perform a non-violent Contest, first the Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Stat Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. The action’s effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The size of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores. If the Attacker uses a Spark Stat Check, then the Defender may roll a Spark Stat Check using either or both of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark Stat Check, so long as the Defender pays the Blessing Die cost.

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character’s will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest, the Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurt. Then the Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene. If the Attacker rolls higher, then the Defender could be trivially injured, in need of immediate medical attention, or even dead. The amount that the Attacker rolled higher than the Defender determines the extent of the injury, regardless if that was what the Attacker intended. If the Defender rolls the same or higher number than the Attacker, then no injury occurs.

If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these attacks with a greater range of options than just Hurry, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

!!! warning "Rules Note: Checks vs. Contests"
    Checks use the terms “fail” and “succeed,” while Contests use “lose” and “win” instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another. For example, the "Blessed by Luck" Ability allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Helping

All characters may can spend their Blessing Dice to Help one another complete Checks and Contests. And your Abilities, events, and items in the story may also Help you in similar ways.

Up to once per roll, whether your own or another character’s, you may Help by spending a number of Blessing Dice, then that character rolls a capped die and adds the result to their roll. The more Blessing Dice spent this way, the larger the capped die rolled, according to the table below. You may only Help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action and your character is not currently engaged in another action.

```@raw html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Blessing Dice Spent</th>
    <th scope="col">Bonus Added</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <td>①</td> <td><span>$+1$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>①①</td> <td><span>$+dc2$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>①①①</td> <td><span>$+dc3$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>①①①①</span></td> <td><span>$+dc4$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>①<span>$\times 5$</span></td> <td><span>$+dc5$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td><span>$\ldots$</span></td> <td><span>$\ldots$</span></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>①<span>$\times 10$</span></td> <td><span>$+dc10$</span></td> </tr>
</table>
```

!!! warning "Rules Note: Many Hands Make Light Work"
    It is more cost effective, for example, for two characters to each spend ①① and both of them Help on an action than for one character to spend ①①①① and do all the Helping by themself!

    This is because the Blessing Dice spent to Help yield diminishing returns: each additional Blessing Die spent this way, on average, provides a smaller bonus than the previous one.

!!! details "DM Note: Situational Help"
    Events may occur where it would be reasonable for characters to receive situational "Help" from the environment, items, careful planning, or so on.

    One approach to representing such situations is to lower the target for the Check or Contest involved.

    Another is to keep the target the same, but offer the player a $+dc2$ bonus to relevant Checks or Contests instead. You can offer this as a flat bonus on top of the relevant rolls, regardless of the result; or you could offer this only if a relevant roll would have failed, as though it were a "protect yourself" Ability. Note though, a small flat bonus is much more powerful than a large "protect yourself."

    For example, an invisibility cloak in a setting with the Hex Stat could be ruled as:

    > Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while wearing this cloak and attempting to move or perform an action unseen, protect yourself for $+dc2$. Moreover, you may roll for such actions using your Hex Stat instead of your Hand Stat as usual.

!!! details "DM Note: Resolving Shopping"
    You can resolve characters shopping for items in a similar way to how you resolve Checks to see if they already came prepared with the item they need. However, the difference is that if they are shopping in a place where it would be reasonable to find the item they want, and it would be reasonable for them to have the money or goods to trade for that item, then you may give them situational Help on the Check.

### Size of Outcomes

In general, rolling higher leads to better outcomes.

Some rules refer to the "size" of an outcome, from Very Minor to Maximum, as determined by the table below.

```@raw html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th scope="col">Succeed a Check by rolling at most...</th>
    <th scope="col">Win a Contest by rolling at most...more than opponent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Very Minor</th> <td>3</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Minor</th> <td>7</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Medium</th> <td>11</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Major</th> <td>15</td> <td>7</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Very Major</th> <td>19</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Maximum</th> <td>20+</td> <td>10+</td> </tr>
</table>
```

!!! warning "Rules Note: Maximum Violence is Lethal"
    Keep in mind that, regardless of the Attacker's intention, a violent Contest with a Maximum outcome *always* leads to immediate death or grave injuries for the Defender.

!!! details "DM Note: Size of Non-violent Outcomes"
    - **Minor-:** A Minor or lower outcome to a non-violent Contest represents the Attacker getting what they wanted, within reason, and with complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains is temporary.
    - **Medium:** A Medium outcome to a non-violent Contest represents a lack of complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains lasts for several rolls by or against the Defender.
    - **Major+:** A Major or higher outcome to a non-violent Contest can change the narrative arc of the session or even campaign.

!!! details "DM Note: Size of Violent Outcomes"
    - **Minor-:** As with non-violent Contests, a Minor or lower outcome to a violent Contest represents a trivial wound that grants the Attacker only a temporary advantage, possibly with complications.
    - **Medium/Major:** A Medium, Major, or Very Major outcome to a violent Contest represents a nontrivial, but non-life-threatening wound that will need medical attention, possibly changing the narrative arc of the session to treat it, granting lasting effects if not treated successfully and in a timely manner.
    - **Maximum:** And a Maximum outcome to a violent Contest represents a serious wound, resulting in immediate death or grave injuries to the Defender needing immediate attention or a miracle.

## Actions: Level 2

There are special rules for when characters perform complex actions while attacking at the same time, and for when characters work together on Checks or Contests as a group.

### Complex Attacks

Sometimes a character's attack in a Contest is itself a complex action requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

In such cases, the DM may set a target the Attacker needs to beat. The attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the DM's target.

When the Defender rolls, if the Defender rolls lower than the DM's target, the Contest is resolved as though the Defender had rolled that target instead.

This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to meet the target.

### Group Checks and Contests

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group.

One way is to provide Help to one roll that leads the group's action. Some members of the group may decide not to roll and instead wait for the group leader to roll, then provide Help to the leader by spending Blessings to increase the result of the roll.

Another way is for each character to attempt the action, using the median of their rolls. If multiple characters are Attackers together in a Contest, Defenders together in a Contest, or are performing a coordinated Check, then they may each perform their respective rolls and use the median of their results as the group's shared result. If the group roll had an even number of individual rolls, then the higher of the two median rolls is used.

These two approaches may even be combined, with some members rolling and taking their median, and the other members providing Help on top of that median. However, a group member cannot both roll and Help for the same action.

In general, once characters become a group as part of a Check or Contest, they remain a group until the end of the Check or Contest and are treated as a single character for the sake of the rules, sharing benefits and risks.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group Defenders"
    A character cannot force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

## Actions: Level 3

There are special rules for when several characters are working towards competing aims at the same time.

### The Camera Rule

To resolve complex situations where several actions are competing for control of the narrative, *Humanity, Blessed* follows The "Camera Rule," inspired by how complex scenes are handled in film and television.

The "Camera Rule" has three parts:

- A character cannot be a part of multiple Contests or Checks at the same time.
- When multiple characters attempt to perform actions that would require Checks or Contests at the same time, only one of these actions can drive the central narrative. This is the Focal Action.
- Other actions that were attempted at the same moment, the Side Actions, could still occur. However, they could also be interrupted, muddled by the chaos of the situation, abandoned by the character in response to the results of the Focal Action, or so on; such incomplete actions are not considered wins, losses, failures, or successes, they simply don't go all the way from idea to execution.

### Simultaneous Actions

When several characters want to complete conflicting actions, all at the same time as they compete towards their respective goals, this requires a round of simultaneous actions.

To resolve a round of simultaneous actions, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Focal Action:** All characters roll for their attempted actions, as though they were performing their desired Check or performing their desired Contest as the Attacker. Only the highest of these rolls continues through as the Focal Action, with the DM resolving ties.
2. **Resolve the Focal Action:** The Focal Action is then resolved. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they perform their rolls as Defenders for that Contest.
3. **Determine and Resolve any Side Actions:** Side Actions are then determined and resolved. Starting with those that rolled the lowest in step 1, if they have already been involved in another Check or Contest this round, regardless if it was by choice, they no longer have the opportunity to act this round. Otherwise, they decide: Do they continue with their original idea, adapt it to the new situation around them, follow a brand new idea, hold their action until during or after another character's action, or abandon acting altogether? If they choose to act, they then perform and resolve their desired Check or Contest. If this action involves other characters, those characters cannot have already been involved in another Check or Contest already this round. Then continue this process with those who rolled the next lowest in step 1.
4. **End:** Once all characters have either been involved in a Check, Contest, or chosen not to act, the round of simultaneous actions is resolved.

For example, if two characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attempt to attack. Then only the higher roll goes through as both an attack and the Focal Action--the lower roll has been interrupted, neither winning, losing, failing, or succeeding. Then the lower roller rolls as a Defender against the attack, narrating how they respond, and effects are determined as usual. And as there were only two characters in this exchange, there were no opportunities for Side Actions by other characters.

For another example, two groups are competing in a battle of the bands, the *Dropkicks* and the *Blast Offffs!*, while a groupie named Sam cheers for the *Dropkicks* from the stands. First, the two groups roll Headline (a special Stat for the setting) and the groupie rolls Heart, all narrating how they attempt to act. Then only the highest of these three rolls goes through as the Focal Action. Let's say it's the *Dropkicks*, and with their music they attempted to summon a dragon of pure music to attack the *Blast Offffs!*. So, the *Blast Offffs!* now roll as a Defender against that attack, and their original plan has been interrupted. Finally, as a Side Action, Sam can continue with their original plan of cheering from the stands, or they can adjust their strategy and choose a different roll in response to the outcome of the *Dropkicks*'s attack.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Groups within Simultaneous Actions"
    Once characters become grouped together for a Check or Contest in a round of simultaneous actions, they remain grouped for the rest of the round.

### Endeavors

Endeavors are multiple rounds of simultaneous actions during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on. Many scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved may be asked to perform Stat Checks to overcome hazards in the environment. Each round, the narrative primarily follows a single Focal Action, then resolves smaller Side Actions before resolving hazards.

To perform an Endeavor:

1. **Setup:** The DM places a token representing each character involved in the Endeavor on a number line, starting at position $0$. Then, the DM describes the winning and losing conditions of the Endeavor, such as being the first to reach at least space $20$ at the end of a round, to have moved the furthest at the end of $3$ rounds, to be the last one standing by avoiding environmental hazards, or so on or some combination of conditions.
2. **Focal Action Advantage Movement:** At the top of each round, determine the Focal Action. Characters may choose to sit out this phase of the Endeavor. Whoever rolled the highest moves forward on the number line a number of spaces equal to the result of their roll. This represents the advantage gained towards their objectives as their proposed course of action directs the narrative tension. If there is a tie for highest roll, then no one gains this advantage movement during this step, though the DM still resolves the tie to determine the Focal Action for the next step.
4. **Focal Action Movement:** Next, resolve the Focal Action. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they roll to defend against it. Then the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the size of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.
5. **Side Action Movements:** Then, determine and resolve Side Actions, starting with those who sat out at the start of the round, then those who rolled the lowest at the start of the round, with the DM resolving ties. For each of these Side Actions, the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the size of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.
6. **Hazards:** At the end of the round, the DM may describe an environmental hazard that could affect all or some of the leading characters involved the Endeavor, asking them to perform a Check to avoid the effects.
7. **End:** Repeat rounds until the Endeavor has been won, lost, ends in a draw, or gets interrupted.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Focal Action Always Gets the Advantage"
    The advantage movement a character gets as a result of rolling the highest when determining the Focal Action is separate from the movement of resolving the Focal Action.
    
    They get their advantage movement whether or not the Focal Action goes on to fail, succeed, win, or lose.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group Movement"
    If a winning or succeeding side in any of the steps above is a group, then when they move forward an amount, they only move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.

!!! warning "Group up and Roll for Focus"
    You cannot roll and provide Help at the same time, so don't rush to roll at the top of the round.
    
    If you and your allies would like to provide Help to one another, first decide how you will form groups. Then act as a group accordingly from there.

!!! details "DM Note: Simplified Focal Action Rolls"
    You may decide to simplify the process of determining the Focal Action by limiting the types of Stats that are applicable each round. For example:

    - The party is ambushed. Ambushers roll Hurt, and the ambushed roll Hurry. Characters cannot sit out this round.
    - The party is playing a game of giant magic chess. Each round, characters must roll Head or sit out.
    - Two bands and their groupies are competing in a battle of the bands. Band members must roll Headline (a custom Stat for the setting), and groupies must sit out.

    Keep in mind how your players actually think about the Endeavor and what their goals are! Simplifying the Focal Action this way removes player autonomy, but it also (a) lowers the cognitive load of thinking up a narrative for one's actions and (b) creates rules around the Endeavor that can make it feel distinct from other Endeavors in the campaign.

!!! details "DM Note: Simplified Endeavor Check Targets"
    Instead of determining a target for each Check in an Endeavor, for most Checks you may allow characters to automatically succeed, but then compare the size of their outcome to the effect they wanted to achieve. Based on that, award them a weaker or stronger or moreorless complete version of that intended effect.

    This allows you to reserve setting targets for Checks where failure would be interesting or that would change the arc of the Endeavor.

    If you use this approach, characters would be unable to activate "protect yourself" Abilities for Checks. So, make it clear the start of the Endeavor if, for the sake of the Endeavor, such Abilities (a) always activate, even without explicit failure, or (b) never activate because of the dire pressure of the situation.

!!! details "DM Note: Multiple Number Lines"
    In Endeavors covering a larger playing field where it would be narratively unsatisfying for characters in different regions of the field to affect one another, you can split the Endeavor into two, at most three, number lines.

    Depending on the situation, characters may be able to change the number line they are on, may be able to only if they succeed a Check or pay a movement cost, or may be able to only if the situation allows.

    Regardless, the Endeavor still only has one Focal Action per round. What changes is that characters are limited in who they can interact with based on which number line they are on.

!!! details "DM Note: Large-Scale Endeavors"
    Resolving actions that occur on massive scales, such as war, democracy, alien invasion, and farming during environmental disaster, requires shifting the scale of the narrative. This can be done in a similar way through one round of an Endeavor, before shifting back to its effects on the player character scale and the actions it makes available to them.

    The details depend on your situation, but you may give the "sides" of the large-scale Endeavor several $d10$ and roll them as a group of dice that bump as usual, for example, $4d10$.

    Then use the results to improvise the narrative at that scale before returning to the view of how that large-scale narrative makes itself known at the smaller player character scale.

### Monstrous Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Muddle Buttons:** When each Monstrosity joins the Endeavor, it adds one or more "muddle buttons" to the number line. When the movement of a player character or one of their allies moves over one of these points on the number line, that Monstrosity is Muddled (see [Example Conditions](#Example-Conditions)) for the next round, representing a momentary crack in the Monstrosity's defenses--literally or figuratively. Then, the button is removed. If a player character or one of their allies would activate multiple muddle buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate. Be warned though, as some Monstrosities have Abilities that grow in power the more times they've been muddled this way!
- **Stamina:** Each Monstrosity has an amount of "stamina." At the end of each round, if the player characters and their allies have a combined value on the number line equal to or greater than a Monstrosity's stamina, those characters may move backwards on the number line a total amount equal to the Monstrosity's stamina. If they do, they non-lethally remove that Monstrosity from the Endeavor and narrate what happens.

!!! details "DM Note: Endeavor Monstrosities"
    See the [Endeavor Monstrosities](monstrosities.md) page for more details and samples for creating monstrosities for monstrous endeavors.

### Stealth Endeavors

Similarly, some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Alarm Buttons:** At the start of the Endeavor, the DM adds a number of "alarm buttons" throughout the number line. If a character ends its first movement of the round on the same space as an alarm button, then the character is "made" by the watchful eye they are trying to avoid. What happens when a character is made this way depends on the Encounter. For example, the party immediately loses when any character is made. Or after a number of times being made, the Endeavor changes. Or when a character is made, they perform a Check whose target is equal to the button's position on the number line, and the character is removed from the Endeavor if they fail that Check. Or so on.
- **Alarm Buttons Move:** At the end of each round, the alarm buttons move, according to some set pattern only the DM knows. Nothing happens immediately when an alarm button ends its movement in the same space as a character. However, if a character chooses to sit out of acting at the top of a round while sharing a space with an alarm button, then the chatacter is made just as though they had moved onto it.
- **Failed Checks Increase Alertness:** Whenever a character fails a Check or loses a Contest while resolving a Focal Action or Side Action, the "alertness" of the Endeavor increases, represented by an additional alarm button being added to the number line.
- **Negative Help:** Whenever a character receives Help, they may choose to subtract the bonus from their roll instead of adding it as usual.

### Discovery Endeavors

Finally, some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters explore a mansion for clues, search through the rubble of a crashed spaceship, delve into a dungeon, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, or added into any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Lay of the Land:** At the top of the first round, the DM will provide the lay of the land of the environment the characters are exploring, such as what rooms are available and how they relate. As the Endeavor progresses, additional areas may become available, each with their own number line and lay of the land. 
- **Glimmer Buttons:** When the DM gives a lay of the land, a number of "glimmer buttons" are added throughout the number line. When the movement of a character moves over one of these points on the number line, that character can attempt to interact with that glimmer button. If a character would activate multiple glimmer buttons in one round, that character instead chooses just one to activate.
- **Interacting with Glimmer Buttons:** To interact with a glimmer button and gain the discovery associated with it, a character must succeed a Check. The target for this Check is equal to the glimmer button's position on the number line. If the character's most recent roll in the Endeavor would have met this target, then the character automatically succeeds this Check. This Check is considered an extension to the character's current course of action and does not provide additional movement toward the Endeavor. When this Check is succeeded, the glimmer button is removed from the number line. It may also be removed when the Check is failed, at DM's discretion.
- **Types of Glimmer Buttons:** The DM may add multiple types of glimmer buttons to the number line, representing different types of discoveries for the area, such as items, information, social interactions, or further areas to explore.
- **History and Glimmer Buttons:** A character may also automatically succeed the Check to interact with a glimmer button if their History Stat die is high enough (at DM discretion) and the scope of their History Stat is relevant enough to the glimmer button in question. In such case, the DM may alternatively use a success on the glimmer button's Check to provide extra benefit or to give the character narrative control for a moment.

!!! details "DM Note: Preparing Glimmer Buttons"
    You do not need to specify ahead of time which discoveries correspond to each glimmer button. Instead, decide which categories of discoveries might be present in the area: items, information, social interactions, traps, or so on.

    Then, for each, decide how copious it might be in the area:

    - Rare: Roll $1d4-2$ and if the result is positive add that many glimmer buttons of that type to the number line. This die bumps as usual. (For even rarer discoveries, you can roll $1d4-3$ or $1d4-4$ instead.)
    - Uncommon: Do the same as above, but with $1d4$.
    - Common: Do the same as above, but with $1d6$.
    - Abundant: Do the same as above, but with $1d8$.
    - Copious: Do the same as above, but with $1d10$.

    Then, improvise following your players' choices. For example, when they decide to interact with a "loot" glimmer at position $10$ instead of a "social" glimmer, ask yourself:
    
    - What are they looking for?
    - What Stat did they use to reach it?
    - What would a "loot" of target $10$ look like?
    - What might be available in this area?
    - How does this area relate to the larger area and events of the story?
    - What information can you present alongside it?
    - What item, result, or information could be given for free based on the character's History scope?
    - If the character will need to roll a new Check to interact with the glimmer, what Stat can you ask them to roll that will add new detail to the scene without being the same Stat they just rolled?

!!! details "DM Note: Automatic Glimmer Button Success"
    While it is up to your discretion, here is a good rule of thumb for how large a character's History Stat die needs to be to automatically succeed a glimmer button's Check: double the largest number on the character's History Stat die then subtract $2$. Any glimmer button whose target is at most that number and also related to the character's History Stat scope could reasonably be automatically succeeded.

    For example, a $d6$ History Stat die could automatically succeed targets $10$ or less for related glimmer buttons.

    Moreover, you can use this rule of thumb to provide information when a character fails a glimmer button's Check: What would a character's History Stat die and scope need to be to automatically succeed, and who in the narrative meets those requirements that the character could turn to for help? This moves the story forward by creating a new "side quest" and expanding the world, without giving away the glimmer button's information right away.

## Conditions

### Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Instead, wounds shape the narrative arcs of the game; the worse the wound, the greater and longer lasting the impact.

!!! details "DM Note: Describing Wounds"
    When describing the results of wounds dealt to or by the player characters, don't only rely on status conditions or descriptions of injuries.
    
    Include variety over the course of the campaign: What does the Attacker *want*? The character's motivations should drive the narrative, not just the game mechanics.
    
    You can treat minor and medium wounds as ways the Attacker can get at what they want from the Defender in the scene, which is not always to just inflict injury on others. And you can treat major wounds as representing going too far using violent means to get what they want.

    When a character suffers a major wound, it can be unsatisfying for them to be immediately removed from the game. Instead, you might draw the tension and possibility to respond out further. One way to do so is to provide the wounded character's allies opportunity to perform a Home Contest against the same roll that the Attacker used to inflict the major wound. If an ally wins the Contest by $5$ or more, then the wound is successfully treated, perhaps reducing it to a medium or minor wound. However, if the Attacker is able to roll $5$ or more on a Hurt Stat Check before the allies can successfully treat the wound, then the Attacker may deliver a *coup de grace* to finish off the wounded.

### Surprise Threat

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump and cannot be a Spark Stat Check.

### Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may attempt a Check to remove this condition.

!!! details "DM Note: Becoming Uncool"
    The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

    How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

    Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

    So when you build the narrative around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Example Conditions

While most effects help shape the narrative of the game, your DM may find it appropriate to apply conditions to characters when the situation calls for it. Some example conditions are given below:

- **Headache/Handcramp/Heartache/Homesick:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. This condition lasts until the end of the scene.
- **Confused/Exhausted/Dejected/Ill:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat cannot receive Help, including Help from items, Abilities, or situations.
- **Weakened:** Rolls you make as a Defender in violent Contests that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. Resting or tending to your wounds ends this condition.
- **Agreeable to $X$:** Rolls you make as a Defender in non-violent Contests where $X$ is an Attacker that would roll the highest value on the die instead roll the second highest. If $X$ does an action or makes a request that would bring you harm, this condition ends.
- **Famous:** You may exert your fame over a character who is less famous than you, gaining a $+dc2$ bonus in a Contest against them. You may not do so against the same character twice or while you are Uncool.
- **Head/Hand/Heart/Home Cursed by $X$:** When $X$ witnesses you perform a roll using the affected Stat, $X$ may have you perform the roll again and use the new value. If they do, this condition ends.
- **Muddled:** The next roll you make when determining the Focal Action in an Endeavor is made with a $-2$ modifier. Then, this condition ends.
- **Exhausted/Cursed:** Dice in your pool of Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $0$. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Distracted:** Rolls you make do not bump. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Disarmed:** If you would win a violent Contest as the Attacker with a Maximum outcome, you win with a Very Major outcome instead. When you find a new weapon or take a moment to recompose yourself, this condition ends.
- **Taxed:** You cannot perform Spark Stat Checks. Spending ①① ends this condition.
