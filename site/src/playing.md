# Playing the Game

## Your Dice

You play this game with two sets of dice:

- Your Stat Dice, representing your general capabilities
- Your pool of Blessing Dice, which are spent to activate different Abilities

### Bumping Dice

Dice in this game “bump.”

When you roll a $1$ on a Stat Die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Succeeding on a Check or winning a Contest without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination and focus on the action.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group of Dice"
    In this game, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Blessing Dice

Characters in this game each have a pool of Blessing Dice, representing a pool of resources they can draw upon to recharge their abilities and help their friends.

The DM will award you Blessing Dice for various achievements.

When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice. And, like your Stat Dice, your Blessing Dice also bump, but in a slightly different way.

When you roll a $1$ on a Blessing Die, instead of rolling again to increase the value of the roll, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Blessing Dice do not Group"
    If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

!!! details "DM Note: When to Award Blessing Dice"
    You as a DM should award players Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters’ abilities depend on them.

    What this looks like can vary per DM, per table, or per scene.

    Some DMs may prefer a “fail forward” approach like in *Kids on Bikes*, where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer a "natural" approach like in *Dungeons and Dragons*, where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

    The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a DM in this game! Use it well!

    All this being said, we recommend new DMs to this game use the following:

    - Award $3$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such as after the player has introduced their character
    - Award a Blessing Die the first time each session the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $5$ or more, and award each other player whose character witnessed or heard about that high win or success a Blessing Dice as well
    - Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions
    - Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both dice this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game; such sessions take place narratively on an "unlucky day"
    - Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story

### Spending Blessing Dice

Some actions can only be performed by first "spending" some number of dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth some value or more.

The notation ① represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $1$ or more. The notation ② represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $2$ or more. And so on.

The notation ①① represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice, each worth $1$ or more. The notation ②② represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice, each worth $2$ or more. And so on.

When a Blessing Die is spent, it is removed from your pool of Blessing Dice.

## Evergreen Abilities

All characters have two "evergreen" Abilities that they can spend their Blessing Dice to activate: Helping one another, and performing Preparedness Checks.

### Helping

Once per roll, whether your own or another character’s, you may Help by spending any number of ① to increase the result of that roll by $+1$ for each ① spent. You may only Help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action.

Additionally, once per another character's roll, but not your own, you may Super-Help by spending ⑥ to increase the severity of the outcome to one rank higher than it would have been otherwise, such as from Minor to Medium. If the character you are helping is a Defender who lost a contest, then the severity of the outcome decreases instead. You may only Super-Help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably assist with the action.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Super-Help does not Stack and Can be Canceled"
    If multiple characters Super-Help the same character, then the severity of the outcome is still only increased by one rank.

    If the Attacker and Defender of a Contest are both Super-Helped, then the two forms of Super-Help cancel each other out, and no change happens to the severity of the outcome.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Super-Help Can Cause or Prevent Fatality"
    Because a violent Contest with a Maximum outcome leads to immediate death or grave injuries for the Defender, a Super-Help could be used to *cause* fatality by increasing an violent outcome from Very Major to Maximum.

    However, a Super-Help could also be used to *prevent* fatality by decreasing a violent outcome from Maximum to Very Major instead, regardless of how much higher the Attacker rolled than the Defender.

### Preparedness

When you need an item your character does not already have listed, it could still be narratively reasonable for your character to have that item on them anyway.

Up to once per scene, to see if your character came prepared with just the item you need, within reason, you may perform a Preparedness Check, which is performed as though rolling a Home Stat Check. If the Check succeeds, you may add the item to your list. Otherwise, you become Unprepared for the rest of the session.

While you are Unprepared, you cannot perform Preparedness Checks.

## Actions

An "action" is anything you choose for your character to do.

Some actions require you to perform rolls to determine the outcome. The simplest of these are Stat Checks and Contests.

The rules for more complex types of actions build up from there.

### Stat Checks

To perform a Stat Check, roll the die for the action’s associated Stat. The DM will let you know which to use. Roll the die, and if the result meets or beats the DM’s target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Stat Check Targets"
    Use $4$ for an easy Stat Check, $8$ for medium, $12$ for hard, $16$ for very hard, and $20$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. The lowest possible Basic Stat Check is $2$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $1$ to $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $12$ is the lowest Stat Check difficulty where a player can begin to fail bad enough for disastrous results.
  
### Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character’s will using any Stat besides Hurt. To perform a non-violent Contest, first the Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Stat Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. The action’s effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The severity of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores. If the Attacker uses a Spark Stat Check, then the Defender may roll a Spark Stat Check using the same Stats, or a Stat Check using either of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark Stat Check.

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character’s will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest, the Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurt, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene. If the Attacker rolls higher, then the Defender could be bruised, dazed, concussed, in need of immediate medical attention, or even dead. The amount that the Attacker rolled higher than the Defender determines the extent of the injury—regardless if that was what the Attacker intended. If the Defender rolls the same or higher number than the Attacker, then no injury occurs.

If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these attacks with a greater range of options than just Hurry, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

!!! warning "Rules Note: Checks vs. Contests"
    Checks use the terms “fail” and “succeed,” while Contests use “lose” and “win” instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another. For example, the "Blessed by Luck" Ability allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Outcome Severity

In general, rolling higher leads to better outcomes.

Some rules refer to the "severity" of an outcome, from Very Minor to Maximum, as determined by the table below.

```@raw html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th scope="col">Succeed a Check by rolling at most...</th>
    <th scope="col">Win a Contest by rolling at most...more than opponent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Very Minor</th> <td>3</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Minor</th> <td>7</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Medium</th> <td>11</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Major</th> <td>15</td> <td>7</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Very Major</th> <td>19</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
  <tr> <th scope="row">Maximum</th> <td>20+</td> <td>10+</td> </tr>
</table>
```

!!! warning "Rules Note: Maximum Violence is Lethal"
    Keep in mind that, regardless of the Attacker's intention, a violent Contest with a Maximum outcome *always* leads to immediate death or grave injuries for the Defender.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Non-violent Effects"
    - **Minor-:** A Minor or lower outcome to a non-violent Contest represents the Attacker getting what they wanted, within reason, and with complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains is temporary.
    - **Medium:** A Medium outcome to a non-violent Contest represents a lack of complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains lasts for several rolls by or against the Defender.
    - **Major+:** A Major or higher outcome to a non-violent Contest can change the narrative arc of the session or even campaign.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Violent Effects"
    - **Minor-:** As with non-violent Contests, a Minor or lower outcome to a violent Contest represents a trivial wound that grants the Attacker only a temporary advantage, possibly with complications.
    - **Medium/Major:** A Medium, Major, or Very Major outcome to a violent Contest represents a nontrivial, but non-life-threatening wound that will need medical attention, possibly changing the narrative arc of the session to treat it, granting lasting effects if not treated successfully and in a timely manner.
    - **Maximum:** And a Maximum outcome to a violent Contest represents a serious wound, resulting in immediate death or grave injuries to the Defender needing immediate attention or a miracle.

## More Actions

### Spark Stat Checks

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

You may spend $2$ dice from your pool of Blessing Dice of the same worth to perform a Spark Stat Check instead of a Basic Stat Check, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each. These Spark Stat Checks represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination -- and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark Stat Check also apply to the Spark Stat Check itself.

!!! warning "Rules Note: You Can Spark After First Roll"
    You can decide to turn a Basic Stat Check into a Spark Stat Check before or after you've made your first roll for the Check.

    For example, when you roll your first $1$ on the die, you can decide to take extra advantage of this opportunity. If you do, pay the Blessing Die cost to Spark, roll your second die, then reroll both for the bump, and add it all together.

### Complex Attacks

Sometimes a character's attack in a Contest is itself a complex action requiring a Check, such as striking a foe while also jumping over a wide chasm.

In such cases, the DM may set a target the Attacker needs to beat. The attack's effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than both the Defender's roll and the DM's target.

When the Defender rolls, if the Defender rolls lower than the DM's target, the attack is resolved as though the Defender had rolled that target instead.

This way, even if the Defender rolls low, they still win the Contest if the Attacker fails to meet the target.

### Group Contests

Sometimes characters want to complete actions together as a group.

If multiple characters are Attackers together in a Contest, then they each perform their respective rolls and the median of their results is used to determine the group’s shared result.

If multiple characters are Defenders together in a Contest, or are performing a coordinated Check, then they each perform their respective rolls, and if at least half would succeed the Check or win the Contest, then the group as a whole succeeds or wins.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group Defenders"
    A character cannot, as part of their attack, force other characters to become a group of Defenders, unless an Ability, item, or situation would allow.

### Simultaneous Actions

Other times, several characters want to complete conflicting actions, all at the same time, as they compete towards their respective goals.

However, a character cannot be a part of multiple Contests or Checks at the same time.

And when multiple characters attempt to perform actions that would require Checks or Contests at the same time, only one of these actions can drive the central narrative. This is the Focal Action.

Other actions that were attempted at the same moment, the Side Actions, could still occur. However, they could also be interrupted, muddled by the chaos of the situation, abandoned by the character in response to the results of the Focal Action, or so on; such actions are not considered wins, losses, failures, or successes, they simply don't go all the way from idea to execution.

To resolve simultaneous actions, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Focal Action:** All characters roll for their attempted actions, as though they were performing their Check or performing their Contest as the Attacker. Only the highest of these rolls continues through as the Focal Action, with the DM resolving ties.
2. **Resolve the Focal Action:** The Focal Action is then resolved. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they perform their rolls as Defenders for that Contest.
3. **Determine and Resolve any Side Actions:** Side Actions are then determined and resolved. Starting with the character that rolled the lowest in step 1, if that character has already been involved in another Check or Contest this simultaneous action, regardless if it was for a Check or as an Attacker or Defender, that character no longer has the opportunity to act this simultaneous action. Otherwise, the character decides: Do they continue with their original idea, adapt it to the new situation around them, follow a brand new idea, or abandon acting altogether? If they choose to act, the character then performs their Check or Contest as usual to resolve their chosen course of action. If this action involves other characters, those characters cannot have already been involved in another Check or Contest already this simultaneous action. Then repeat this process with the character who rolled the next lowest in step 1.
4. **End:** Once all characters have either been involved in a Check, Contest, or chosen not to act, the simultaneous action is resolved.

For example, if two characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attempt to attack. Then only the higher roll goes through as an attack and as the Focal Action--the lower roll has been interrupted, neither winning, losing, failing, or succeeding. Then the lower roller rolls as a Defender against the attack, narrating how they respond, and effects are determined as usual. And as there were only two characters in this exchange, there were no opportunities for Side Actions by other characters.

### Endeavors

Endeavors are series of simultaneous actions during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on. Many scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as Endeavors.

Endeavors are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters attempt actions and perform Contests and Checks to drive the narrative tension, progress themselves, and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved may be asked to perform Stat Checks to overcome hazards in the environment. Each round, the narrative primarily follows a single Focal Action, then resolves smaller Side Actions before resolving hazards.

To perform an Endeavor:

1. **Setup:** The DM places a token representing each character involved in the Endeavor on a number line, starting at position $0$. Then, the DM describes the winning and losing conditions of the Endeavor, such as being the first to reach at least space $20$ at the end of a round, to have moved the furthest at the end of $3$ rounds, to be the last one standing by avoiding environmental hazards, or so on or some combination of conditions.
2. **Focal Action Advantage:** At the top of each round, determine the Focal Action for the round's simultaneous action. Characters may choose to sit out this phase of the Endeavor. The highest rolling character then moves forward on the number line a number of spaces equal to the result of their roll. This represents the advantage gained towards their objectives as their proposed course of action directs the narrative tension. If there is a tie for highest roll, then no character moves forward on the number line during this step, though the DM still resolves the tie to determine the Focal Action.
4. **Focal Action Movement:** Next, resolve the Focal Action. If the Focal Action had Defenders, they roll to defend against it. Then the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the severity of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.
5. **Side Action Movements:** Then, determine and resolve Side Actions, starting with those who sat out at the start of the round, then those who rolled the lowest at the start of the round, with the DM resolving ties. For each of these Side Actions, the winning or succeeding side moves forward, and the severity of the outcome determines the number of spaces moved, according to the table below.
6. **Hazards:** At the end of the round, the DM may describe an environmental hazard that could affect all or some of the leading characters involved the Endeavor, asking them to perform a Check to avoid the effects.
7. **End:** Repeat rounds until the Endeavor has been won, lost, ends in a draw, or gets interrupted.

```@raw html

  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th scope="col">Spaces Moved</th>
  </tr>

```

!!! warning "Rules Note: Movement as a Result of a Check or Contest"
    If a character moves forward as a result of taking the focus, that movement is separate from the amount they move forward as a result of the Check or Contest when it subsequently resolves.
    
    Moreover, even if that character subsequently fails that Check or loses that Contest, the character still gains their movement from driving the Focal Action in the first place.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group Movement"
    If a winning or succeeding side in any of the steps above is a group performing a Group Check or Group Contest, then when they move forward an amount, they move a total of that amount. How the group distributes this movement among its members is up to the group to decide: they may distribute the movement evenly, give it all to one member, or any other arrangement the group agrees on.

!!! details "DM Note: Simplified Focal Action Rolls"
    You may decide to simplify the process of determining the Focal Action by limiting the types of Stats that are applicable each round. For example:

    - The party is ambushed. Ambushers roll Hurt, and the ambushed roll Hurry. Characters cannot sit out this round.
    - The party is playing a game of giant magic chess. Each round, characters must roll Head or sit out.
    - Two bands and their groupies are competing in a battle of the bands. Band members must roll Headline (a custom Stat for the setting), and groupies must sit out.

    Keep in mind how your players actually think about the Endeavor and what their goals are! Simplifying the Focal Action this way removes player autonomy, but it also (a) lowers the cognitive load of thinking up a narrative for one's actions and (b) creates rules around the Endeavor that can make it feel distinct from other Endeavors in the campaign.

### Monstrous Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve the player characters and their allies facing off against Monstrosities, like zombies, robots, or the manifestation of someone's fear!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Muddle Buttons:** When each Monstrosity joins the Endeavor, it adds one or more "muddle buttons" to the number line. When a player character or one of their allies reaches one of these points on the number line, that Monstrosity is Muddled (see [Example Conditions](#Example-Conditions)) for the next round, representing a momentary crack in the Monstrosity's defenses -- literally or figuratively. Then, the button is removed. If a player character or one of their allies would activate multiple muddle buttons as part of the same movement, that character instead chooses just one to activate. Be warned though, as some Monstrosities have Abilities that grow in power the more times they've been muddled this way!
- **Stamina:** Each Monstrosity has an amount of "stamina." At the end of each round, if the player characters and their allies have a combined value on the number line equal to or greater than a Monstrosity's stamina, those characters may move backwards on the number line a total amount equal to the Monstrosity's stamina. If they do, they non-lethally remove that Monstrosity from the Endeavor and narrate what happens.

!!! details "DM Note: Endeavor Monstrosities"
    See the [Endeavor Monstrosities](monstrosities.md) page for more details and samples for creating monstrosities for monstrous endeavors.

## Conditions

### Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Instead, wounds shape the narrative arcs of the game; the worse the wound, the greater and longer lasting the impact.

!!! details "DM Note: Describing Wounds"
    When describing the results of wounds dealt to or by the player characters, don't only rely on status conditions or descriptions of injuries.
    
    Include variety over the course of the campaign: What does the Attacker *want*? The character's motivations should drive the narrative, not just the game mechanics.
    
    You can treat minor and medium wounds as ways the Attacker can get at what they want from the Defender in the scene, which is not always to just inflict injury on others. And you can treat major wounds as representing going too far using violent means to get what they want.

    When a character suffers a major wound, it can be unsatisfying for them to be immediately removed from the game. Instead, you might draw the tension and possibility to respond out further. One way to do so is to provide the wounded character's allies opportunity to perform a Home Contest against the same roll that the Attacker used to inflict the major wound. If an ally wins the Contest by $5$ or more, then the wound is successfully treated, perhaps reducing it to a medium or minor wound. However, if the Attacker is able to roll $5$ or more on a Hurt Stat Check before the allies can successfully treat the wound, then the Attacker may deliver a *coup de grace* to finish off the wounded.

### Surprise Threat

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump and cannot be a Spark Stat Check.

### Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may attempt a Check to remove this condition.

!!! details "DM Note: Becoming Uncool"
    The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

    How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

    Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

    So when you build the narrative of around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Example Conditions

While most effects help shape the narrative of the game, your DM may find it appropriate to apply conditions to characters when the situation calls for it. Some example conditions are given below:

- **Headache/Handcramp/Heartache/Homesick:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat are made with a $-1$ modifier. This condition lasts until the end of the scene.
- **Weakened:** Rolls you make as a Defender in violent Contests are made with a $-2$ modifier. Resting or tending to your wounds ends this condition.
- **Agreeable to $X$:** Rolls you make as a Defender in non-violent Contests where $X$ is an Attacker are made with a $-2$ modifier. If $X$ does an action or makes a request that would bring you harm, this condition ends.
- **Head/Hand/Heart/Home Cursed by $X$:** When $X$ witnesses you perform a roll using the affected Stat, $X$ may have you perform the roll again and use the new value. If they do, this condition ends.
- **Muddled:** The next roll you make to take the focus in an Endeavor is made with a $-2$ modifier. Then, this condition ends.
- **Exhausted/Cursed:** Dice in your pool of Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $0$. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Distracted:** Rolls you make do not bump. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Disarmed:** If you would win a violent Contest as the Attacker by $10$ or more, you win by $9$ instead. When you find a new weapon or take a moment to recompose yourself, this condition ends.
- **Taxed:** You cannot perform Spark Stat Checks. Spending ①① ends this condition.
- **Robbed:** You cannot perform Preparedness Checks. This condition ends when you spend time in a place where items could be restocked.
