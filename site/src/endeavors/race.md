# Race Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve a prolonged scene where the player characters race against one another or their opponents, whether it be on foot, on horseback, in sleds, in cars, or even in spaceships!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Endurance Checks:** At the end of each round, if a character spent Blessings that round, they must succeed a Check to remain in the race, representing the character's endurance to keep racing after a hard push. The target for this Check is equal to the total number of Blessings the character has spent this Endeavor.
- **Terrain Buttons:** At the top of the first round, the DM will describe the shape of the race course, adding a number of "terrain buttons" to the number line to represent hills, brush, holes, asteroid fields, or so on that slow the racers down. The first time a character would move past a terrain button's position on the number line, they instead end their movement for the round on the same space as the button.
- **Escape Bonus:** If a character gains advantage movement as a result of rolling the highest when determining the Focal Action, and they began that movement on the same space as a terrain button, they gain two bonuses to their advantage movement. First, they move forward on the number line an additional $+2$. And second, they may ignore up to one terrain button they would move past during this movement.
- **Types of Terrain Buttons:** The DM may add multiple types of terrain buttons to the number line, representing different types of terrain obstacles for the area, such as hills, stampedes, quantum puzzles, or trolley problem moral dilemmas. When a character begins the round on a terrain button, the type of the terrain button may constrain what Stats they may roll or what actions they may take.
