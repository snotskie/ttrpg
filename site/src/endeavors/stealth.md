# Stealth Endeavors

Some campaigns or sessions may involve prolonged tension where the player characters attempt to sneak past guards, escape a prison, perform a heist, or so on!

These sorts of Endeavors are run like any other Endeavor, with the following additions:

- **Alarm Buttons:** At the start of the Endeavor, the DM adds a number of "alarm buttons" throughout the number line. If a character ends its first movement of the round on the same space as an alarm button, then the character is "made" by the watchful eye they are trying to avoid. What happens when a character is made this way depends on the Encounter. For example, the party immediately loses when any character is made. Or after a number of times being made, the Endeavor changes. Or when a character is made, they perform a Check whose target is equal to the button's position on the number line, and the character is removed from the Endeavor if they fail that Check. Or so on.
- **Alarm Buttons Move:** At the end of each round, the alarm buttons move, according to some set pattern only the DM knows. Nothing happens immediately when an alarm button ends its movement in the same space as a character. However, if a character chooses to sit out of acting at the top of a round while sharing a space with an alarm button, then the chatacter is made just as though they had moved onto it.
- **Failed Checks Increase Alertness:** Whenever a character fails a Check or loses a Contest while resolving a Focal Action or Side Action, the "alertness" of the Endeavor increases, represented by an additional alarm button being added to the number line.
- **Negative Help:** Whenever a character receives Help, they may choose to subtract the bonus from their roll instead of adding it as usual.
