# World of One-Shots

## Setting

The following provides launching off points for running one-shot campaigns set in a comedic, surreal fantasy inspired by films like *FernGully* and *Flintstones*. In a paleolithic era, filled with ancient counterparts to today's modern amenities and customs, the adventuring party sets off into a land of magic, secret orders, day jobs, arcane inventions, sea-faring humans, forest fae, moutain-dwelling beetles, college students just trying to find themselves, and more. The Great Dragons gave the world its sentience -- now what the heck are we to do with it?
