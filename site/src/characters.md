# Making Your First Character

## Basic Stats

Each character in this game has a small number of Basic Stats, the "H‚Äôs of Humanity" described below. Together, these represent a character's general capabilities at a wide range of tasks and situations.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step One!"
    Green boxes like these provide questions to help guide you as you create your first character!
    
    Your first task is to decide which Stats your character is best (and worst) at. Rank your Stats for your character: What are they most capable at? least capable at? just middly capable at?
    
    As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. Why are they good at this and not at that? Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

**üß† Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music. With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. With a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach

**‚úåÔ∏è Hand:** Athletic pursuits, sleight of hand, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly. With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. With a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud, clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way

**üíï Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally. With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. With a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are

**ü©π Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, taking hits, tending to wounds, shopping, scavenging, survival skills, cooking, navigating towns and dwellings, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. With a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you seem to always misplace things

**üëø Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. With a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. With a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like

**‚è≥ History:** Narrative touchstones representing your unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, hardships, and other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people, but not covered by or more specific than the other Basic Stats above. With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialized training you set out to achieve. With a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often

When you begin the game, most of your Basic Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Basic Stat Checks. However, the Basic Stat you ranked as your highest Stat begins the game one die size larger. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Basic Stat dice.

All of your Basic Stat dice can be upgraded later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

!!! details "DM Note: Creating Other Stats"
    For your campaign setting, you may find it helpful to create a new Stat for your players.
    
    For example, you might create a Stat to represent the "magic" of the setting:
    
    > - **üê¶‚Äçüî• Hex:** Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *E.g., for a magic or fantasy style setting.*
    > - **ü•ï Ham:** Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *E.g., for a cartoon style setting.*
    > - **ü¶æ Hardware:** Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *E.g. for a cyberpunk style setting.*
    > - **üîé Hunch:** Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *E.g. for a film noir style setting.*
    > - **üëæ Hologram:** Directly investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within. *E.g. for a futuristic style setting.*
    > - **üí∞ Hireling:** Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *E.g. for an absurd capitalist style setting.*
    > - **üéÅ Holly Jolly:** Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *E.g. for a winter wonderland style setting.*
    > - **üéß Headline:** Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *E.g. for a battle of the bands style setting.*
    > - **ü¶† Host:** Drawing on the power of your symbiote to push beyond your normal capabilities. Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while using this Stat, protect yourself for $+dc2$. There may be consequences. *E.g. for an alien paranormal suspense style setting.*

    Or you might create a Stat to represent how characters relate to a unique obstacle of the setting:
    
    > - **üíÄ Hardship:** Shared narrative touchstones of the story setting that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. This Stat cannot be upgraded beyond a $d4$, but can still be involved in Spark Stat Checks and be boosted by Abilities like other Basic Stats. *E.g. for a suspense horror style setting.*
    > - **üëª Haunted:** Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's fears, a curse they can't escape, or a malevolent force that haunts them. This Stat begins the game as a $d10$, yet can be decreased in the same way other Stats are normally increased, down to a minimum of a $d4$. Players do not choose to use this Stat. Instead, whenever the thing that haunts them is present (whether the character is aware of its presence or not), after the character has performed a roll, they then roll their Haunted Stat and subtract its value from the original roll's result. This Stat's die bumps as normal. *E.g. for a Poe style setting.*
    > - **üå≥ Hardy:** Shared narrative touchstones emerging from each session's obstacles that represent the players' combined efforts against the challenges they have faced. This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d4$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy die instead of one of their other Stat dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d4$. *E.g. for a coming of age style setting.*
    > - **‚ö´ Haze:** Dark narrative touchstones representing a character's descent into madness or confusion. This die begins the game as a $dc1$ and is only increased when the character fails certain Checks or loses certain Contests against the ever-present darkness, at which point it increases by one capped die size. When another character makes an action against this character, that other character may choose to use this character's Haze Stat die instead of their own usual die for the roll. *E.g. for a psychological horror style setting.*
    
    However, please note, if you want to create a new Stat, it must:

    - Not already be covered by the first six Stats: Head, Hand, Heart, Home, Hurt, Hurry. Otherwise, you risk increasing the number of confusing moments of when one Stat applies over the other, and you risk spreading the players' resources too thin when they go to upgrade their Stats.
    - Be something all players would want to upgrade (or intentionally keep low for story purposes) and function the same for all players. Otherwise, it would be simpler to cover this "Stat" with History and let the players decide who will specialize in it, how they will specialize in it, and who will leave it alone.
    - Be the only new Stat you have added to your game. Otherwise, you risk creating a situation where players each have a large number of Stats that go relatively unused.
    - Not sound too similar to another Stat, such as "Handling" and "Hand." Otherwise, you risk confusing situations at the table where people mishear each other.

    Although Stats you create do not need to start with the letter "H," big kudos if you can keep the alliteration going!

    Finally, if you create a new Stat, the Lifestyle options as written will not benefit your new Stat. So, when your players upgrade their Lifestyle and receive a benefit to one of the first six Basic Stats, they may have that Lifestyle benefit your new Stat instead.

## Lifestyle

Each character in this game starts with one of three Lifestyles, described below. Lifestyle upgrade options are described in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop). A character's Lifestyle represents their general background and goals, and can change over the course of the story.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Two!"
    Begin to describe the Lifestyle your character had growing up or their current outlook on life. As you do, pick one of the following Lifestyles to start the game with. These can be changed later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

**üçÄ Carefree:** Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your naivete, wealthy upbringing, optimistic demeanor, or (in a darker setting) a nihilistic worldview. Two of your Stats begin the game one die size larger, according to the table below. Work with your DM to know which column to use.

**üî• Eager:** Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, a person you want to impress, or a mission or faith you believe strongly in. Two of your Stats begin the game one die size larger, according to the table below. Work with your DM to know which column to use.

**üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened:** Maybe life has not been easy on your character, but if so you‚Äôve come out wiser and tougher. Perhaps you've been shaped by unfortunate events, you've dedicated yourself to your work, or (in some settings) you could take advantage of others easily because you understand how people work. Two of your Stats begin the game one die size larger, according to the table below. Work with your DM to know which column to use.

```@raw html

  <tr>
    <td></td>

  <tr> <th scope="row">Wisened</th> <td>Head and Home</td> <td>Hand and Hurry</td> <td>Heart and Hurt</td> </tr>
</table>
```

!!! details "DM Note: Campaign Genre Archetype"
    The default Stat bonuses characters in your campaign setting receive as a result of their Lifestyle help give shape and flavor to the narrative. This happens by creating a sense of what life looks like in the setting, or is assumed to look like in the stories characters tell one another, all before the first session has even begun!

    To help you make the choice of what default Stat bonuses to give, consider the following as you imagine the genre you want to provide your players and the value systems entrenched in the game setting's world:

    - **Virtue and Vice** settings are those where well-developed virtues naturally align with roles in harmonious or mystical worlds--and vices run counter to it, manifesting as a "dark side" to the good in the world. This is likely the most familiar genre archetype, especially for good vs. evil stories. *E.g. for high fantasy, utopian sci-fi, shonen, optimistic post-apocalyptic worlds, mythological, magical realism, allegorical fables, urban fantasy, and children's stories.* The Blossomed, Driven, and Steadfast upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings, and deviation from them could represent character growth away from the default expectations of the setting's world.
    - **Fate and Knowledge** settings are those where characters' personal traits connect them to mystical or supernatural forces, shaping their destinies through divine, cursed, or esoteric interactions. This genre archetype resists feeling familiar as it often subverts familiarity in order to invoke unsettling feelings. *E.g. for dark fantasy, gothic fiction, mystical post-apocalypse, psy-fi, cosmic horror, occult fiction, dystopian fiction, and supernatural horror.* The Prodigious, Chosen, and Warry upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings, and deviation from them could represent character growth away from the default expectations of the setting's world.
    - **Cunning and Capability** settings are those where creativity, intellect, and guile define roles in intricate, high-stakes environments focused on survival, power, or ingenuity. This genre archetype is likely familiar, and fits stories well that have high stakes without necessarily a clear good vs. evil component. *E.g. for  cyberpunk, steam punk, hard sci-fi, spy fiction, heist fiction, josei, surveillance-state fiction, noir, and antihero/villain stories.* The Crafty, Wired, and Compelling upgrade options are the most "default" in such settings, and deviation from them could represent character growth away from the default expectations of the setting's world.

    In any case, provide your players with a small set of default Stat bonuses to choose from that both have in-game flavor and balance the first three Stats (Head, Hand, Heart) with the second three Stats (Home, Hurt, Hurry). These default Stat bonuses allow players to get into the game quicker, while setting them up for character growth later when (or if) they choose to upgrade their Lifestyle in the Session Shop.

## History

Each character has a History Basic Stat, made up of a number of narrative touchstones. This Stat is used to perform actions related to the character's backstory more than to the other Basic Stats. And even though every character has a History Basic Stat, what their History covers is unique to them and only them!

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Three!"
    Begin to describe your character's backstory. Answer the following prompts, or others given to you by your DM. These background details will help you and your DM build the story and set the scope of the narrative touchstones your History Stat Checks cover.
    
    - Describe who your character looks up to, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
    - List three specific skills that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
    - List three specific people or groups that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
    - Describe where your character could be found on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
    - If your game's setting has non-human characters and your character is one of them, work with your DM to determine how your non-human background affects the scope of your Stats.

!!! warning "Rules Note: When History Overlaps Other Stats"
    Yellow boxes like these provide important notes about the rules!
    
    When both your History Stat and another Basic Stat would be applicable in a situation, the DM may decide which applies more. Otherwise, you choose which to use.

!!! details "DM Note: Scope of History Stat"
    As you work with your players to develop their backstory, come up with a list of three to five specific narrative touchstones for each player that describe what their History Stat covers. For example:

    - Tying Knots (for a scout)
    - Swordfighting (for a knight)
    - Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn)
    - Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician)
    - Acting (for a theater kid)
    - Manipulating Technology (for a hacker)
    - Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer)
    - Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the Empire)
    - Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the Empire)

    Consider what *unique* skills, proficiencies, traits, and backstory elements each character brings to the story. Also consider the *variety* of a character's narrative touchstones: if all or most of them would be covered already by another Basic Stat, then the player would have no reason to use or upgrade their History Basic Stat!

!!! details "DM Note: Party History"
    While the party of player characters does not share a "group History," you may still find it useful to keep a short list of shared details over the course of the campaign, such as reputation, effect of the market on the party's business, shifting political tensions, or so on.
    
    This list can aid you when asking players to reflect on their character's own relationship to that "group History," which can help shape their own History scope, advance the development of their character, and inspire you for ideas for following scenes or sessions.

!!! details "DM Note: Non-Human Characters"
    If your game's setting allows your players to create non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to represent non-human details. The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds between your players:

    - **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's History Stat to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their non-human background could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.
    - **Low Variety:** If player characters all come from just a few non-human background options, then using History to cover this background would clog the scope of the Stat with details that aren't unique to each player. Instead, expand the scope of two or three of the other Stats to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.

## Abilities

Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, and Backstory to flesh out their key defining traits!

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Four!"
    Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. Have you seen characters like them before in movies, TV shows, and books? Try to envision the people from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

    With that in mind, pick two of the following Abilities to start the game with. As you do, you may also want to consult the [Playing the Game](playing.md) page to learn more about the rules these Abilities interact with.
    
    You can gain additional Abilities later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

---

### Survival Instinct

Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while rolling your Hurry Stat, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Protect Yourself for $+dcX$"
    Blue boxes like these provide explanation for common shorthanded wordings for effects in this game.
    
    When an effect describes a possibly failed Check or lost Contest and says to ‚Äúprotect yourself for $+dcX$,‚Äù you gain a $+dcX$ bonus to the roll, as though you were Helped by the trait that protected you, possibly turning the failure into a success or loss into a win. You can only be protected this way once per roll. If multiple effects would protect you this way during the same roll, only one of them applies and you choose which one to use.

### Careful Resolve

Whenever you would fail a Check while performing dangerous actions, protect yourself for $+dc2$. *This Ability requires and extends Survival Instinct.*

!!! note "Effect Wording: Requires and Extends"
    Some Abilities "require" another Ability. Such Abilities cannot be gained until you've first gained the required Ability.

    Some Abilities also "extend" another Ability. When you gain such an Ability, it does not count against your total number of Abilities. However, you can only extend any particular Ability once this way. If an Ability would extend an already extended Ability, it still does count against your total number of Abilities.

### Blessed by Responsiveness

During an Endeavor involving three or more characters, when determining the Focal Action, you may reduce the result of your own roll to $0$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Survival Instinct.*

!!! note "Effect Wording: Spend ‚ìç to Recharge"
    Some Abilities, once activated, cannot be activated again until they have been "recharged" by spending ‚ìç from your pool of Blessing Dice.

---

### Armored Skin

Whenever you would lose a violent Contest as the Defender, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Blessed by Thorns

When you lose a violent Contest at a close distance, you may have your Attackers receive a less severe version of the same injury you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Armored Skin.*

### Blessed by Sentry

When another nearby character would be the Defender in a violent Contest, before they roll, you may become the Defender in that Contest instead. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Armored Skin.*

---

### Quick Acclimation

Whenever you would fail a Check against natural effects such as weather and disease, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Best Friend

You gain access to a creature companion of your choice appropriate to the setting and within reason. Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while working with and alongside your companion, protect yourself. The amount you protect yourself by depends on the companion and the Stat used, ranging from $+0$ to $+dc4$. If this companion is lost, stolen, destroyed, or you lose its loyalty, replacing it may require time and effort. *This Ability requires and extends Quick Acclimation.*

### Blessed by Conviction

Once per action, you may ignore the negative effects of one of your injuries or conditions. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it.  *This Ability requires and extends Quick Acclimation.*

---

### Licensed Driver

Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest to transport supplies or other characters, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Transport Authority

You gain access to a vehicle of your choice appropriate to the setting and within reason. Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while operating this vehicle, protect yourself. The amount you protect yourself by depends on the vehicle and the Stat used, ranging from $+0$ to $+dc4$. If this vehicle is lost, stolen, or destroyed, replacing it may require time and effort. *This Ability requires and extends Licensed Driver.*

### Blessed by Copilots

While transporting others, you may designate one or more other characters you are transporting. When they Help you during that transport, their costs to do so are reduced by ‚ë†. *This Ability requires and extends Licensed Driver.*

---

### Blessed by Steadfastness

Up to once per session, when you fail a Check or lose a Contest by $5$ or more, gain a Blessing.

### Blessed by Family

You may attack recklessly, using Home for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. This attack is potentially lethal to your target if you win, and you may sustain injuries if you lose. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Blessed by Steadfastness.*

### Blessed by Charity

When you visit a place of religious or spiritual importance, you may spend any number of ‚ë† as a donation or act of service to the place. The more spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the DM. *This Ability requires and extends Blessed by Steadfastness.*

!!! details "DM Note: Blessed by Charity's Boon"
    How you rule the boon given by the "Blessed by Charity" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

    However, some ideas are:

    - Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
    - Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
    - Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

---

### Blessed by Collaboration

Whenever you spend ‚ë†‚ë† or more to Help another character, they gain a bonus as though you had spent an additional ‚ë†‚ë†.

### Synchronized Spark

You may perform a Spark Stat Check using one of your Stats and one of the Stats of another willing character in the scene, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced, both characters have this ability, and the Blessing Die cost is paid between the two characters. *This Ability requires and extends Blessed by Collaboration.*

### Epic Storytelling

Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell a rousing story or give a rousing speech. Each other character who hears the story or speech gains a Blessing Die. *This Ability requires and extends Blessed by Collaboration.*

---

### Radical Self-Acceptance

While you are Uncool, you may roll Checks using a different Basic Stat than normal. Then once a Check succeeds this way, you are no longer Uncool.

### Ascendant Spark

You may perform a non-violent Spark Stat Check using three Stats instead of two, so long as those Stats each use a $d8$ or larger and you pay double the Blessing Die cost as usual. *This Ability requires and extends Radical Self-Acceptance.*

### Epic Awkwardness

Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell an cringy joke or perform an embarrassing dance. Each other character who hears the joke or witnesses the dance becomes Uncool. *This Ability requires and extends Radical Self-Acceptance.*

---

### Efficiently Packed

Whenever you would fail a Check to see if you already have an item on you, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Blessed by Luck

When you fail a Check, you may attempt the Check again, using the newer result instead. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Efficiently Packed.*

### Epic Fortitude

Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may declare boldly that you have exactly the right item or idea you need for the situation. When you succeed your next Check during the same scene, increase the size of the outcome to one rank higher than it would have been otherwise, such as from Minor to Medium. *This Ability requires and extends Efficiently Packed.*

---

### Tactful Speech

Whenever you would lose a Contest trying to persuade, influence, inspire, or deceive others, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Blessed by Wits

When you lose a non-violent Contest against a single Attacker, you may have the Attacker receive a less severe version of the same effect you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Tactful Speech.*

### Blessed by Intrigue

Up to once per scene, you may end, begin, or modify one rumor. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Tactful Speech.*

---

### Line of Credit

Whenever you would fail a Check or lose a Contest while purchasing goods or services, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Blessed by Insurance

When a character fails a Check or loses a Contest to tend to your wounds, that character may turn the failure into a success or the loss into a win. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to recharge it, and when it is recharged, increase the cost to recharge it by ‚ë†‚ë†. *This Ability requires and extends Line of Credit.*

### Blessed by Voices

You may call upon a higher power, a criminal underground, a book of forbidden knowledge, or so on to gain access to secret information or an answer to a question that you wouldn't normally be able to do. This information may come with consequences. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it. *This Ability requires and extends Line of Credit.*

---

### Sharp Recall

Whenever you would fail a Check trying to recall information, protect yourself for $+dc2$.

### Optimal Solution

Up to twice per session, when you or a nearby ally attempt a roll for a non-violent Check or Contest, you may roll $4d6$; these dice do not bump. Group those dice into two piles of two dice such that a simple operation (addition or multiplication) could be performed to each pile so that the two operations' results would be equal. For example, if you rolled $1$, $1$, $1$, and $2$, you could group the piles such that $1√ó2=1+1$. If you are able to arrange the $4d6$ in such a way, you or your ally increases the result of their attempted roll by $+5$. *This Ability requires and extends Sharp Recall.*

### Shower Thoughts

Up to once per session, when you are resting or performing leisure activity in a safe place, you may perform a roll using Head or Home. Then up to once before the end of the session, you may use the value of that roll instead of rolling for a Check or non-violent Contest using any Stat. *This Ability requires and extends Sharp Recall.*

---

### Advanced Training

Increase the result of your rolls using a $d8$ or larger by $+1$.

### Ease of Focus

Your rolls using a $d8$ or larger also bump when you roll a $2$ on the die. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

### Focused Determination

Each time you bump your dice, increase the result of the roll by an additional $+1$. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

### Ambidexterity

In a Monstrous Endeavor you may activate two muddle buttons per round. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

### Calling Card

Up to once per Stealth Endeavor, when you would be made you may instead increase the alertness of the Endeavor. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

### Quick Scan

Up to once per Discovery Endeavor, when a lay of the land is given, you may choose a type of glimmer button. More of that type will be added to the number line than usual. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

### Honorable Combat

You may attack honorably, using Hand for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. If you would win the Contest with a Maximum outcome, you win with a Very Major outcome instead, which cannot be increased by other effects. Moreover, you leave yourself open to dirty tricks; if the Defender attacks you with Hurt at the same time, they gain a $+dc2$ bonus to the roll, as though Helped by your attempt at honorable combat. *This Ability requires and extends Advanced Training.*

---

### Blessed by Circumstance

During a roll involving three or more characters, you may swap the results of two characters‚Äô rolls. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it. *This Ability requires a $d8$ or larger in Head or Hurry.*

### Blessed by Disruption

When another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may modify that character‚Äôs result by $-3$, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it. *This Ability requires a $d8$ or larger in Hand or Hurt.*

### Blessed by Drama

Up to twice per session, when your character is not present in the scene, you may introduce something into the narrative, such as an item, a friend, an enemy, an event, a description, or so on. The DM will then improvise or riff on your idea. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§‚ë§ to recharge it. *This Ability requires a $d8$ or larger in Heart or Home.*

### Past Repeated

Up to once per session, when you fail a Check or lose a non-violent Contest, you may choose to channel a past memory to guide you. If you do, for the rest of the scene, you may use your History Stat in place of the Stat you failed the Check or lost the Contest with, even for actions not typically covered by your History Stat. *This Ability requires a $d8$ or larger in History.*

!!! details "DM Note: Replacing Abilities"
    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to lose or replace a Ability. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of Abilities is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    One suggestion is this: Whenever a player gains a new Ability, allow them the opportunity to also replace one of their existing Abilities.

## Items

There is not an appendix of items to choose from in this game. Instead, items are narrative and help shape the course of the story. Each character tracks a list of items they typically carry with them, and other items they may have with them can be determined in the moment. Over the course of the story, characters may perform Checks to find new items, create new items, purchase and sell items, and even see if they already have items that could be narratively reasonable for them have.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Five!"
    List three or four items your character always carries, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

!!! details "DM Note: Creating NPCs"
    You do not need to go through the entire character creation process to create NPCs for your table. Instead, you only need the following and can improvise the rest:

    - Scope of History Stat and History Stat Die
    - What the NPC's motivation and quirks are and how they relate to two PCs' histories
    - One other Stat's die that is unusually high or low compared to the rest
    - One Stat Die shared by all the other Stats
    - At most one Ability. If the Ability would require recharging to be used, instead roll a $d6$ as though gaining a Blessing Die. If the NPC would gain a Blessing Die worth enough to recharge the Ability, instead recharge the Ability immediately
