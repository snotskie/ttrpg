## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, designed to tell stories, about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

## Basic Stats

Each character in this game has a small number of Basic Stats, represented by the "H‚Äôs of Humanity" described below. Together, these few Basic Stats describe a character's general capabilities at a wide range of tasks and situations.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step One!"
    Green boxes like these provide questions to help guide you as you create your first character!
    
    Your first task is to decide which Stats your character are best (and worst) at. Rank your Stats for your character: What are they most capable at? least capable at? just middly capable at?
    
    As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. Why are they good at this and not at that? Why is one important to them and not the other? What are they trying to improve? What do they like getting help from others on?

**üß† Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music. With a high Head Stat you can tackle intellectual puzzles with ease. With a low Head Stat you may find yourself confounded easily or solutions to puzzles just outside your reach

**‚úåÔ∏è Hand:** Athletic pursuits, sleight of hand, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly. With a high Hand Stat you are in complete control of your physical efforts. With a low Hand Stat you may tire easily or loud and clanky obstacles might somehow always be in your way

**üíï Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally. With a high Heart Stat you understand others' intentions easily and can act accordingly. With a low Heart Stat others maybe just aren't as enthused about your interests as you are

**ü©π Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, taking hits, tending to wounds, haggling, survival skills, cooking, navigating towns and dwellings, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared. With a high Home Stat you can easily be depended upon in situations both mundane and dire. With a low Home Stat your estimates of health and money matters might frequently be off or you always seem to always misplace items

**üëø Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others. With a high Hurt Stat you can easily steel your resolve when the time calls for violent answers. With a low Hurt Stat your caring for others' well-being seems to extend even to your enemies

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline. With a high Hurry Stat you find that your body moves easily to keep you safe from danger. With a low Hurry Stat you might freeze up more often than you'd like

**‚è≥ History:** Narrative touchstones representing your unique specializations, skills, proficiencies, hardships, and other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people, but not covered by or more specific than the other Basic Stats above. With a high History Stat you have achieved the specialized training you set out to achieve. With a low History Stat your specific worries and weaknesses seem to creep up more often

When you begin the game, most of your Basic Stats are equal, using a $d4$ for their Basic Stat Checks. However, the Basic Stat you ranked as your highest Stat begins the game one die size larger. Your Lifestyle also increases your starting Basic Stat dice.

All of your Basic Stat dice can be upgraded later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

!!! details "DM Note: Creating Other Stats"
    For your campaign setting, you may find it helpful to create a new Stat for your players. For example:
    
    > - **üê¶‚Äçüî• Hex:** Use of wands, spells, potions, and other magical instruments, traps, lore, and knowledge. *E.g., for a Misfits and Magic style setting.*
    > - **ü•ï Ham:** Use of outlandish solutions, cartoonish items, and pun-based bends of reality. *E.g., for a Roger Rabbit style setting.*
    > - **ü¶æ Hardware:** Use of machines, robotics, and cybernetic implants. *E.g. for a Cyberpunk style setting.*
    > - **üîé Hunch:** Locating clues, guessing the right solution to a puzzle, being in the right place at the right time. *E.g. for a film noir style setting.*
    > - **üëæ Hologram:** Investigating, interacting with, noticing inconsistencies in, and reshaping the simulation the characters exist within directly. *E.g. for a Matrix style setting.*
    > - **üí∞ Hireling:** Acquiring employees, minions, or quest companions, and effectively delegating tasks and operating a business. *E.g. for an Acquisitions Incorporated style setting.*
    > - **üéÅ Holly Jolly:** Drawing from the magic of the season to bring people joy, operating devices from the North Pole, and interacting with reindeer, snowmen, yetis, and other such fantastical beasts. *E.g. for a winter wonderland style setting.*
    > - **üéß Headline:** Performing music on stage, in a garage with your band, moving in sync with the beat. *E.g. for a Scott Pilgrim style setting.*
    > - **üíÄ Hardship:** Shared narrative touchstones of the story that represent the town's obstacles, troubles, and adversities. This Stat cannot be upgraded beyond a $d4$, but can still be involved in Spark Stat Checks and be boosted by Abilities like other Basic Stats. *E.g. for a Stephen King style setting.*
    > - **üå≥ Hardy:** Shared narrative touchstones emerging from each session's obstacles that represent the player's shared efforts against the challenges they have faced. This Stat is shared by all players at the table, and it cannot be upgraded by the normal means. Instead, it begins each session as a $d4$. When a player fails a Check or loses a Contest against a non-player character, this Stat upgrades to the next die size, to a maximum of a $d10$. Any player may choose to use the Hardy die instead of one of their other Stat dice for any roll; when they do, this Stat returns to a $d4$. *E.g. for a basic Kids on Bikes setting.*
    
    However, please note, if you want to create a new Stat, it must:

    - Not already be covered by the first six Stats: Head, Hand, Heart, Home, Hurt, Hurry. Otherwise, you risk increasing the number of confusing moments of when one Stat applies over the other, and you risk spreading the players' resources too thin when they go to upgrade their Stats.
    - Be something all players would want to upgrade and function the same for all players. Otherwise, it would be simpler to cover this "Stat" with History and let the players decide who will specialize in it, how they will specialize in it, and who will leave it alone.
    - Be the only new Stat you have added to your game. Otherwise, you risk creating a situation where players each have a large number of Stats that go relatively unused.
    - Not sound too similar to another Stat, such as "Handling" and "Hand." Otherwise, you risk confusing situations at the table where people mishear each other.

    Although Stats you create do not need to start with the letter "H," big kudos if you can keep the alliteration going!

    Finally, if you create a new Stat, the Lifestyle options as written will not benefit your new Stat. So, when your players upgrade their Lifestyle and receive a benefit to one of the first six Basic Stats, they may have that Lifestyle benefit your new Stat instead.

## Lifestyle

Each character in this game starts with one of three Lifestyles, described below. Lifestyle upgrade options are described in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop). A character's Lifestyle represents their general background and goals, and can change over the course of the story.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Two!"
    Begin to describe the Lifestyle your character had growing up or their current outlook on life. As you do, pick one of the following Lifestyles to start the game with. These can be changed later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

**üçÄ Carefree:** Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your young age, wealthy upbringing, or optimistic demeanor. Your Heart and Hurry Stats each begin the game one die size larger.

**üî• Eager:** Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a teenage rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, or a person you want to impress. Your Hand and Hurt Stats each begin the game one die size larger.

**üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened:** Life has not been easy on your character, but as a result you‚Äôve come out wiser and tougher, perhaps because you‚Äôve gotten older, been shaped by unfortunate events, or dedicated yourself to your work. Your Head and Home Stats each begin the game one die size larger.

## History

Each character has a History Basic Stat, made up of a number of narrative touchstones. This Stat is used to perform actions more related to the character's backstory more than to the other Basic Stats. And even though every character has a History Basic Stat, what their History covers is unique to them and only them!

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Three!"
    Begin to describe your character's backstory. Answer the following prompts, or others given to you by your DM. These background details will help you and your DM build the story and set the scope of the narrative touchstones your History Stat Checks cover.
    
    - Describe who your character looks up to, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
    - List three specific skills that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
    - List three specific people or groups that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to, whether "good" or "bad" connections
    - Describe where your character could be found on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
    - If your game's setting has non-human characters and your character is one of them, work with your DM to determine how your non-human background affects the scope of your Stats.

!!! warning "Rules Note: When History Overlaps Other Stats"
    Yellow boxes like these provide important notes about the rules!
    
    When both your History Stat and another Basic Stat would be applicable in a situation, the DM may decide which applies more. Otherwise, you choose which to use.

!!! details "DM Note: Scope of History Stat"
    As you work with your players to develop their backstory, come up with a list of three to five specific narrative touchstones for each player that describe what their History Stat covers. For example:

    - Tying Knots (for a scout)
    - Swordfighting (for a knight)
    - Breathing Fire (for a dragonborn)
    - Reading Legal Documents (for the child of a politician)
    - Acting (for a theater kid)
    - Manipulating Technology (for a hacker)
    - Stunt Driving (for a stunt performer)
    - Friendly Interactions with the Empire (for someone raised in the Empire)
    - Unfriendly Interactions with the Rebels (for someone raised in the Empire)

    Consider what *unique* skills, proficiencies, traits, and backstory elements each character brings to the story. Also consider the *variety* of a character's narrative touchstones: if all or most of them would be covered already by another Basic Stat, then the player would have no reason to use or upgrade their History Basic Stat!

!!! details "DM Note: Non-Human Characters"
    If your game's setting allows your players to create non-human characters, there are generally two approaches for how to resolve non-human abilities. The choice depends on the variety of non-human backgrounds between your players:

    - **High Variety:** If each player character has a different non-human background, then the simplest option is to use each character's History Stat to cover one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of their non-human background could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.
    - **Low Variety:** If player characters all come from just a few different non-human background options, then using History to cover this background would clog the scope of the Stat with details that aren't unique to each player. Instead, expand the scope of two or three of the other Stats to cover one or two simple actions each, within reason, that characters of their non-human backgrounds could perform unaided that human characters couldn't.

## Abilities

Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, and Backstory to flesh out their key defining traits!

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Four!"
    Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. Have you seen characters like them before in movies, TV shows, and books? Were they the bully in school? Do they get drawn into conspiracy theories? Are they so laid-back that others think they're a slacker? Are they beautiful and popular? Are they quiet and hardworking? Etc. Try to envision the tropes from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

    With that in mind, pick two of the following Abilities to start the game with. As you do, you may also want to consult the [Playing the Game](playing.md) page to learn more about the rules these Abilities interact with.
    
    You can gain additional Abilities later in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

**Survival Instinct:** When a ‚ë† is spent to Help one of your rolls using your Hurry Stat, the result of your roll is increased by $+2$ instead of $+1$.

**Focused Determination:** Each time you bump your dice, increase the result of the roll by an additional $+1$.

**Efficiently Packed:** When you perform a Preparedness Check, you may have the roll bump when you roll a $2$ on the die.

**Past Repeated:** Up to once per session, when you fail a non-violent Check or lose a non-violent Contest, you may choose to channel a past memory to guide you. If you do, for the rest of the scene, you may use your History Stat in place of the Stat you failed the Check or lost the Contest with, even for actions not typically covered by your History Stat.

**Armored Skin:** Whenever you lose a violent Contest as the Defender, protect yourself for $+3$.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Protect Yourself for $+X$"
    Blue boxes like these provide explanation for common shorthanded wordings for effects in this game.
    
    When an effect describes a failed Check or lost Contest and says to ‚Äúprotect yourself for $+X$,‚Äù you suffer the results as though you had rolled $+X$ higher. This cannot turn the failure into a success or loss into a win, but it can reduce the severity of the outcome.

**Careful Resolve:** Whenever you fail a Check while performing dangerous stunts or procedures, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Tactful Speech:** Whenever you lose a Contest trying to persuade others, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Quickly Acclimated:** Whenever you fail a Check against natural effects such as weather and disease, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Licensed Driver:** Whenever you fail a Check or lose a Contest while transporting others, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Optimal Solution:** Up to twice per session, when you or a nearby ally attempt a roll for a non-violent Check or Contest, you may roll $4d6$; these dice do not bump. Group those dice into two piles of two dice such that a simple operation (addition or multiplication) could be performed to each pile so that the two operations' results would be equal. For example, if you rolled $1$, $1$, $1$, and $2$, you could group the piles such that $1√ó2=1+1$. If you are able to arrange the $4d6$ in such a way, you or your ally increases the result of their attempted roll by $+5$.

**Synchronized Spark:** You may perform a Spark Stat Check using one of your Stats and one of the Stats of another willing character in the scene, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced, both characters have this ability, and the Blessing Die cost is paid between the two characters.

**Ascendant Spark:** You may perform a non-violent Spark Stat Check using three Stats instead of two, so long as those Stats each use a $d8$ or larger and you pay double the Blessing Die cost as usual.

**Advanced Training:** Increase the result of your rolls using a $d8$ or larger by $+1$.

**Ease of Focus:** Up to once per scene, you may have one of your rolls using a $d8$ or larger bump when you roll a $2$ on the die.

**Radical Self-Acceptance:** While you are Uncool, you may roll Checks using a different Basic Stat than normal. Then once a Check succeeds this way, you are no longer Uncool.

**Honorable Combat:** You may attack honorably, using Hand for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. If you would win the Contest by $10$ or more, you win by $9$ instead. Moreover, you leave yourself open to dirty tricks; if the Defender attacks you with Hurt at the same time, the result of their attack's roll is increased by $+2$.

**Blessed by Luck:** When you fail a Check, you may attempt the Check again, using the newer result instead. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Spend ‚ìç to Recharge"
    Some abilities, once activated, cannot be activated again until they have been "recharged" by spending ‚ìç from your pool of Blessing Dice.

**Blessed by Circumstance:** During a roll involving three or more characters, you may swap the results of two characters‚Äô rolls. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Self-Sacrifice:** During an Endeavor involving three or more characters, when attempting to take the focus, you may reduce the result of your own roll to $0$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it.

**Blessed by Voices:** You may learn more about a character, place, or fact than would normally be possible, and this knowledge may come with consequences. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Family:** You may attack recklessly, using Home for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. This attack is potentially lethal to your target if you win, and you may sustain injuries if you lose. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Charity:** When you visit a place of religious or spiritual importance, you may spend any number of ‚ë† as a donation or act of service to the place. The more spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the DM.

!!! details "DM Note: Blessed by Charity's Boon"
    How you rule the boon given by the "Blessed by Charity" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

    However, some ideas are:

    - Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
    - Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
    - Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

**Blessed by Thorns:** When you lose a violent Contest at a close distance, you may have your Attackers receive a less severe version of the same injury you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Wits:** When you lose a non-violent Contest against a single Attacker, you may have the Attacker receive a less severe version of the same effect you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Steadfastness:** When you fail a Check or lose a Contest by $5$ or more, gain a Blessing.

**Blessed by Disruption:** When another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may modify that character‚Äôs result by $-3$, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Insurance:** When a character fails a Check or loses a Contest to tend to your wounds, that character may turn the failure into a success or the loss into a win. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to recharge it, and when it is recharged, increase the cost to recharge it by ‚ë†‚ë†.

**Epic Storytelling:** Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell a rousing story or give a rousing speech. Each other character who hears the story or speech gains a Blessing Die.

**Epic Inventory:** Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may declare boldly that you have exactly the item you need in the situation. You may perform a Preparedness Check even if you are Unprepared, and you may perform this Check using any Basic Stat.

**Epic Awkwardness:** Up to once per session, when your pool of Blessing Dice has a total combined worth of at least $10$, you may tell an cringy joke or perform an embarrassing dance. Each other character who hears the joke or witnesses the dance becomes Uncool.

!!! details "DM Note: Replacing Abilities"
    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to lose or replace a Ability. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of Abilities is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    One suggestion is this: Whenever a player gains a new Ability, allow them the opportunity to also replace one of their existing Abilities.

## Items

There is not an appendix of items to choose from in this game. Instead, items in this game are narrative and help shape the course of the story. Each character tracks a list of items they typically carry with them, and other items they may have with them can be determined in the moment.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Five!"
    List three items that your character never leaves home without, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

!!! details "DM Note: Creating NPCs"
    You do not need to go through the entire character creation process to create NPCs for your table. Instead, you only need the following and can improvise the rest:

    - Scope of History Stat and History Stat Die
    - What the NPC's motivation and quirks are and how they relate to two PCs' histories
    - One other Stat's die that is unusually high or low compared to the rest
    - One Stat Die shared by all the other Stats
    - At most one Ability. If the Ability would require recharging to be used, instead roll a $d6$ as though gaining a Blessing Die. If the NPC would gain a Blessing Die worth enough to recharge the Ability, instead recharge the Ability immediately

## Session Shop

At the end of each session, you receive one free upgrade for your character. Upgrade options are listed below. Some upgrades you receive immediately, and some you receive at the end of the following session.

You may also spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to receive an additional upgrade beyond the one you receive for free. You can keep spending Blessings to receive additional upgrades this way, but each additional upgrade costs ‚ë†‚ë† than the last.

!!! compat "Basic Stat Upgrade Options"
    You may upgrade a single Basic Stat's die one size, from a $d4$ to a $d6$, from a $d6$ to a $d8$, or a $d8$ to a $d10$. If you do, you receive this upgrade immediately.

!!! compat "History Upgrade Options"
