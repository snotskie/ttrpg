# Unnamed TTRPG

## Stats

Each character in this game has six Stats, represented by the "six H’s" described below. Together, these Stats describe a character's general capabilities at wide ranges of tasks and situations.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step One!"
    Your first task is to decide which Stats your character is best (and worst) at! Rank your "six H's" from the one your character is most capable at to least capable at. As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. Why are they good at this and not at that? Why is one important to them and not the other?

**Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music

**Hand:** Athletic pursuits, sleight of hand, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly

**Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally

**Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, taking hits, tending to wounds, haggling, survival skills, cooking, navigating towns and dwellings, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared

**Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others

**Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline

## Lifestyle

Each character in this game has one of three Lifestyles, described below. A character's Lifestyle represents their general background and goals, and can change over the course of the story.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Two!"
    Begin to describe the Lifestyle your character had growing up or their current outlook on life. As you do, pick one of the following Lifestyles to start the game with.

**Carefree:** Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your young age, wealthy upbringing, or optimistic demeanor. Increase the results of your rolls using Heart or Hurry by +1. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +3.

**Eager:** Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a teenage rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, or a person you want to impress. Increase the results of your rolls using Hand or Hurt by +1. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +3.

**Wisened:** Life has not been easy on your character, but as a result you’ve come out wiser and tougher, perhaps because you’ve gotten older, been shaped by unfortunate events, or dedicated yourself to your work. Increase the results of your rolls using Head or Home by +1. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +3.

    ```
    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to change their Lifestyle. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of the Lifestyle is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    However, a suggestion is this: If a player has not spent any Level-ups on their Lifestyle, they simply lose one and gain the other. But if they have spent Level-ups this way, then first remove one Level-up from their old Lifestyle and grant them the new Lifestyle. This way, you can represent their status of being between two Lifestyles. Over the course of the story, have them continue to transfer Level-ups from the first Lifestyle to the new one until the old one is gone entirely.
    
    In any case, don't let players have more than a +3 bonus to any stat while transitioning from one Lifestyle to the other.

## Background

Beyond their general capabilities, characters in this game may be able to draw upon their background training and expert abilities to grant them a small bonus (up to +2) to rolls that benefit from this background.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Three!"
    Begin to describe your character's back story and list three specific skills that they have proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, or so on.

## Hero

Characters in this game have Heros that they look up to. Once per session, when you succeed a Check or win a Contest by 5 or more while acting as your Hero would, gain 3 Blessings.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Four!"
    Describe who your character looks up to, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and where is their Hero up to in the world now?

## Basic Abilities

Characters in this game have a set of Basic Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Basic Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, Background, and Hero to make up their key defining traits.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Five!"
    Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. Have you seen characters like them before in movies, TV shows, and books? Were they the bully in school? Do they get drawn into conspiracy theories? Are they so laid-back that others think they're a slacker? Are they beautiful and popular? Are they quiet and hardworking? Etc. Try to envision the tropes from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

    With that in mind, pick two of the following Basic Abilities to start the game with.

    You may spend two Level-ups to gain a third, and three Level-ups to gain a fourth. You may then spend five Level-ups to create one of your own and gain it, within reason.

**Blessed by Luck:** Once per scene, when you fail a Check, you may spend 2 Blessings to roll a Luck Check. If the Luck Check succeeds, then the original failure becomes a success.

**Blessed by Friendship:** Once per scene, you may spend a Blessing to help another character no matter the distance between you.

**Blessed by Action:** Whenever you succeed a Check by 5 or more, each character that witnessed the success gains a Blessing.

**Blessed by Circumstance:** During a Contest involving three or more characters, you may spend 2 Blessings to swap the results of two characters’ rolls.

**Blessed by Voices:** Once per scene, you may spend 2 Blessings to learn more about a character, place, or fact than you normally would be able to.

**Blessed by Family:** You may spend 2 Blessings to attack recklessly, using Home for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. This attack is potentially lethal to your target if you win, and you may sustain injuries if you lose.

**Blessed by Self-Acceptance:** While you are Uncool, once per scene, you may spend 2 Blessings to gain an Inspiration.

**Blessed by Charity:** When you visit a place of religious or spiritual importance, you may spend any number of Blessings as a donation or act of service to the place. The more Blessings spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the DM.

**Cursed Blessing:** Whenever another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may spend 2 Blessings to modify that character’s result by -2, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss. You may spend a Level-up to increase this effect by an additional -1, to a maximum of -5.

**Medically Insured:** Once per scene, when a character fails a Check or loses a Contest to tend to your wounds, characters may spend a combined total of 3 Blessings to turn the failure into a success or the loss into a win. Then, increase the number of Blessings needed to activate this ability by 2.

**Simple Innocence:** Once per scene, you may simplify a Blessing when dealing with an authority figure.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Simplify a Blessing"
    When an effect describes a situation and says to “simplify a Blessing,” you may spend a Blessing to increase the result of a roll by +3 instead of the usual +1d4.

**Simple Fame:** Once per scene, you may simplify a Blessing when dealing with characters who know of your work.

**Simple Accounting:** Once per scene, you may simplify a Blessing when dealing with money.

**Focused Determination:** Whenever you bump your dice twice or more in a single roll, increase the result of the roll by +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

**Armored Skin:** Whenever you lose a violent Contest as the Defender, protect yourself for +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Protect Yourself for +X"
    When an effect describes a failed Check or lost Contest and says to “protect yourself for +X,” increase the result of your roll by +X. This cannot turn the failure into a success or loss into a win, but it can reduce the severity of the outcome.

**Careful Resolve:** Whenever you fail a Check while performing dangerous actions, protect yourself for +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

**Tactful Speech:** Whenever you lose a Contest trying to persuade others, protect yourself for +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

**Quickly Acclimated:** Whenever you fail a Check against natural effects such as weather and disease, protect yourself for +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

**Steady Emotions:** Whenever you fail a Check or lose a Contest and would become Uncool as a result, protect yourself for +2. You may spend a Level-up to increase this bonus by an additional +1, to a maximum of +5.

    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to lose or replace a Basic Ability. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of Basic Abilities is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    However, a suggestion is this: Whenever a player spends Level-ups to gain a new Basic Ability, allow them the opportunity to also replace one of their existing Basic Abilities.

## Fantastic Abilities

Some characters in this game contain within them a spark of magic, an ability to achieve amazing feats, or a penchant for pulling out surprising wins. These Fantastic Abilities are represented by a pair of effects: one that grants the character a number of Inspirations, and another that grants an effect for spending those Inspirations.

These Fantastic Abilities allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination -- and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Six!"
    Read through the following Fantastic Ability options. Which resonate with the image of your character beginning to form in your mind? Which seem to capture best what your character dreams about when they dream they have powers, or the powers that most wished they had in their day to day life?

    With that in mind, pick one of the following Fantastic Abilities to start the game with.

    You may spend three Level-ups to gain a second. You may then spend six Level-ups to create one of your own and gain it, within reason.

**Stalk and Haunt:** You are inspired by slipping into shadows to hide successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve feats such as appearing suddenly from another shadow within view, ambushing a character from the darkness, or learning secrets from ghosts long-forgotten.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Inspired"
    When an effect describes a type of action and says you are “inspired” by it, once per session, when you succeed a Check or win a Contest by 5 or more to complete actions of that type, you gain 3 Inspirations.

**Dash and Rescue:** You are inspired by moving through a mob or chaotic environment safely and successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve feats such as moving yourself and another character or object safely to another location within sight, attacking multiple targets with a single ranged weapon, or remaining still without receiving harm.

**Prevent and Mitigate:** You are inspired by creating a safe perimeter or reducing the risk of a dangerous task successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve such feats as dispelling barriers, tending to wounds, or assembling non-violent constructs sworn to protect you.

**Wound and Weaken:** You are inspired by inflicting injury successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve such feats as inflicting negative status effects, robbing someone of their life force, or summoning natural disasters.

**Unravel and Foretell:** You are inspired by solving complex puzzles successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as seeing a vision from another place, time, or dimension, erase memories, or astral project.

**Lift and Hold:** You are inspired by performing feats of raw strength successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as moving, throwing, crushing, or restraining heavy objects, breaking locks, or crashing safely to the ground even after a great fall.

**Mercy and Might:** You are inspired by acting with utmost honor, chivalry, or in accordance with your oaths successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as compelling others into combat, stumbling upon magical quests, or speaking with animals.

**Slap and Stick:** You are inspired by using items not for their intended uses to solve problems creatively and successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as crafting new items from component parts around you, turning a violent Contest non-violent, or carrying out a pun-based attack.

**Amaze and Confound:** You are inspired by creating or performing works of art successfully. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as deceiving and confusing others, creating illusions, or creating duplicates of complex objects.

**Rouse and Rally:** Whenever another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by 5 or more, and you had spent a Blessing or an Inspiration to increase their result, gain 3 Inspirations. You may spend 2 Inspirations to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to achieve a feat such as setting the mood or soundtrack of the scene to grant your allies a positive status effect.

## Items

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Seven!"
    List three items that your character never leaves home without, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

When you need an item your character does not already have listed, it could still be narratively reasonable for your character to have that item on them anyway. Once per scene, to see if your character came prepared with just the item you need, within reason, spend a Blessing and perform a Home Stat Check. If you roll equal to or greater than twice the number of items you have listed, then the Check succeeds and you may add the item to your list. Otherwise, the Check fails and you may not perform another Home Check.

## Stat Dice

This game uses six dice: 1d10, 2d8, 2d6, and 1d4.

Your highest stat uses the d10 for its Stat Die.

Your second and third highest stats each use a d8 for its Stat Die.

Your fourth and fifth highest stats each use a d6 for its Stat Die.

And your lowest stat uses the d4 for its Stat Die.

## Bumping Dice

Dice in this game “bump.”

When you roll a 1 on a die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a 1 on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as 2d6. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a 1 on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a 1 on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group of Dice"
    In this game, 2d6 is different from 1d6+1d6. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the 2d6 group are rerolled when either rolls a 1. However, the dice of the 1d6+1d6 are considered separate groups, so rolling a 1 on one of the dice only affects that one die.

## Stat Checks

To perform a Stat Check, roll the Stat Die for the action’s associated Stat. The DM will let you know which to use. Roll the die, and if the result meets or beats the DM’s target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

!!! black "DM Note: Setting Stat Check Targets"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    Use 3 for an easy Stat Check, 6 for medium, 9 for hard, 12 for very hard, and 15 for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. 
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into, and each difficulty level above that is roughly equivalent to what the players could reach by spending one more Blessing. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by 2 or 3. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that 12 is the lowest difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.
    ```@raw html
    </details>
    ```

## Highs and Lows

When you succeed on a Check or win a Contest by 5 or more above the number you needed to reach, then something extra cool may happen. On the other hand, when you fail a Check or lose a Contest by 5 or more, then something extra bad may happen. Failing or losing by 10 or more can be disastrous.

## Blessings and Inspirations

Several times during a session, the DM may award you a Blessing, represented by a small token. Less often, an effect may award you an Inspiration.

Once per roll, whether your own or another character’s, you may spend a Blessing to increase the result of that roll by +1d4 or an Inspiration to increase the result of that roll by +1d6. You may only spend Blessings and Inspirations to help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably help with the action.

!!! warning "Rules Notes: Helping as a Team"
    While a single character can give only one Blessing or Inspiration per roll to help another character, multiple characters can come together to give multiple Blessings or Inspirations together to that character.

!!! black "DM Note: When to Award Blessings"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    Mechanically, players may earn Blessings by acting as their Hero would to great success. However, you as a DM should award them Blessings consistently and throughout each session, as many characters’ abilities depend on them.

    However, what this looks like can vary per DM, per table, or per scene.

    Some DMs may prefer a “fail forward” approach like in *Kids on Bikes*, where Blessings are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer a "natural" approach like in *Dungeons and Dragons*, where they award them when the players roll some lucky number before modifiers, like 8. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, or so on. And having the source of Blessings suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

    The way you award Blessings is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a DM in this game! Use it well!
    ```@raw html

    ```

## Special Checks

There are two special checks in this game, Luck Checks and Fantastic Stat Checks.

**Luck Checks:** At times the DM or an effect may ask you to perform a Luck Check, representing moments in the story that are best left to fate alone. To perform a Luck Check, roll 2d8. If the result is 12 or higher, the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

**Fantastic Stat Check:** Some effects may ask you to perform a Fantastic Stat Check to carry out actions beyond your normal capabilities. To perform a Fantastic Stat Check, perform a Stat Check for the action’s associated Stat, but use 2d6 in place of the usual Stat Die.

!!! black "DM Note: Setting Fantastic Stat Check Targets"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    Use 9 for an easy Fantastic Stat Check, 12 for medium, 15 for hard, 18 for very hard, and 21 for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. These difficulties are substantially higher than their mundane Stat Check counterparts, representing both the greater capability yet greater risk of their Fantastic Abilities.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into, and each difficulty level above that is roughly equivalent to what the players could reach by spending one more Blessing. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by 2 or 3. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that 12 is the lowest difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.

## Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by -1. Once during each scene that follows, you may be asked to attempt a Check to remove this condition.

!!! black "DM Note: Becoming Uncool"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

    How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by 5 or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

    Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

    So when you build the narrative of around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

## Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character’s will using any Stat besides Hurt. To perform a non-violent Contest, first the Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Stat Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. The action’s effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The severity of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores.

!!! black "DM Note: Severity of Non-violent Effects"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    A difference less than 5 on a nonviolent Contest represents a minor effect or the Attacker getting what they wanted, within reason, and with complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains is temporary.
    
    A difference of at least 5 but less than 10 represents a medium effect or a lack of complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains lasts for several rolls by or against the Defender.
    
    And a difference of 10 or more represents a major effect than can change the narrative arc of the session or even campaign.
    ```@raw html
    </details>
    ```

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character’s will using their Hurt stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest, the Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Stat Check, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene. If the Attacker rolls higher, then the Defender could be bruised, dazed, concussed, in need of immediate medical attention, or even dead. The amount that the Attacker rolled higher than the Defender determines the extent of the injury—regardless if that was what the Attacker intended. If the Defender rolls the same or higher number than the Attacker, then no injury occurs.


!!! black "DM Note: Severity of Violent Effects"
    ```@raw html
    <details><summary>For DM eyes only! Click to reveal</summary>
    ```
    As with nonviolent Contests, a difference less than 5 represents a minor wound that grants the Attacker only a temporary advantage.
    
    A difference at least 5 but less than 10 represents a wound that will need medical attention, possibly changing the narrative arc of the session to treat it, granting lasting effects if not treated successfully and in a timely manner.
    
    And a difference of 10 or more on a violent Contest represents immediate death or grave injuries to the Defender needing immediate attention or a miracle.
    ```@raw html
    </details>
    ```

If both characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attack, then they each roll as Defenders, narrating how they respond. Injuries are then determined as usual.

If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these attacks with a greater range of options, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

!!! warning "Rules Note: Checks vs. Contests"
    Checks use the terms “fail” and “succeed,” while Contests use “lose” and “win” instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another. For example, Blessed by Luck allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Eager Lifestyle on the other hand does grant a bonus to Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

## Chases

Chases are extended Contests during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, or for the Defenders to reach their destination before being caught by the Attackers.

Chases are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters perform Contests against one another to progress themselves and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved perform Stat Checks to overcome hazards in the environment.

## Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Instead, wounds shape the narrative arcs of the game. Additionally, Attackers may gain a bonus to their rolls when they target a wounded character; the worse the wound, the bigger the bonus.

## Combat Positions

Positions during combat are tracked narratively. There are four ranges: touching, nearby, ranged, and distant. When an Attacker attacks with a weapon they are trained in that is appropriate for their current range to their target, the attacker receives a +2 bonus to their roll.

## Group Checks and Contests

If multiple characters are Attackers together in a Contest, then they each perform their respective rolls and the median of their results is used to determine the group’s shared result.

If multiple characters are Defenders together in a Contest, or are performing a coordinated Check, then they each perform their respective rolls, and if at least half would succeed the Check or win the Contest, then the group as a whole succeeds or wins.
