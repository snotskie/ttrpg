## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, designed to tell stories, about what it means to be human.

## Basic Stats

Each character in this game has seven Basic Stats, represented by the "seven H‚Äôs" described below. Together, these Basic Stats describe a character's general capabilities at wide ranges of tasks and situations.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step One!"
    Your first task is to decide which Stats your character is best (and worst) at! Rank your "seven H's" from the one your character is most capable at to least capable at. As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. Why are they good at this and not at that? Why is one important to them and not the other?

**üß† Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music

**‚úåÔ∏è Hand:** Athletic pursuits, sleight of hand, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly

**üíï Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally

**ü©π Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, taking hits, tending to wounds, haggling, survival skills, cooking, navigating towns and dwellings, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared

**üëø Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline

**‚è≥ History:** Aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people not covered by the other Basic Stats above

When you begin the game, all of your Basic Stats are equal, each using a $d4$ for their Basic Stat Checks.

!!! compat "Session Shop: Basic Stats"
    At the end of a session, you may:

    - spend $2$ unspent Blessings to upgrade a single Basic Stat's die from a $d4$ to a $d6$
    - spend $3$ unspent Blessings to upgrade a single Basic Stat's die from a $d6$ to a $d8$
    - spend $4$ unspent Blessings to upgrade a single Basic Stat's die from a $d8$ to a $d10$
    
    For the Basic Stat you ranked the highest, upgrading its die costs 1 fewer Blessing each time. However, for the Basic Stat you ranked the lowest, upgrading its die costs $1$ additional Blessing each time

## Lifestyle and History

Each character in this game has one of three Lifestyles, described below. A character's Lifestyle represents their general background and goals, and can change over the course of the story.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Two!"
    Begin to describe the Lifestyle your character had growing up or their current outlook on life. As you do, pick one of the following Lifestyles to start the game with.

**üçÄ Carefree:** Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your young age, wealthy upbringing, or optimistic demeanor. Increase the results of your rolls using Heart or Hurry by $+1$.

**üî• Eager:** Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a teenage rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, or a person you want to impress. Increase the results of your rolls using Hand or Hurt by $+1$.

**üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened:** Life has not been easy on your character, but as a result you‚Äôve come out wiser and tougher, perhaps because you‚Äôve gotten older, been shaped by unfortunate events, or dedicated yourself to your work. Increase the results of your rolls using Head or Home by $+1$.

!!! compat "Session Shop: Carefree"
    If your starting Lifestyle was Carefree, at the end of a session you may spend $4$ unspent Blessings to change your Lifestyle to Prodigious or Crafty.
    
    **üîÆ Prodigious:** Your studies have come effortlessly to you, and secrets almost seem to just reveal themselves to you. When you have sparks, they take on a sorcerous or uninhibited aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Head or Hurt by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

    **üß∂ Crafty:** You can envision amazing designs and, it seems, to bring them to life. When you have sparks, they take on an autonomous or lucky aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Hand or Home by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

!!! compat "Session Shop: Eager"
    If your starting Lifestyle was Eager, at the end of a session you may spend $4$ unspent Blessings to change your Lifestyle to Chosen or Wired.

    **‚ú® Chosen:** You draw inspiration from the community around you, setting out on your journeys blessed, favored, or cursed. When you have sparks, they take on a divine or noble aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Heart or Home by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

    **‚ö° Wired:** Your mind is quick and analytical, and you can see solutions to problems that are unimaginably complex. When you have sparks, they take on a calculating or duplicative aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Head or Hurry by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

!!! compat "Session Shop: Wisened"
    If your starting Lifestyle was Wisened, at the end of a session you may spend $4$ unspent Blessings to change your Lifestyle to Warry or Compelling.

    **üëÅÔ∏è Warry:** You are one with the natural and supernatural worlds around you, and you have a keen sense of danger and safety. When you have sparks, they take on an astral or prophetic aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Hand or Hurry by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

    **üëÑ Compelling:** You seem able to spin any loss into a win--or vice versa--, and you are a sly, tactical force to be reckoned with. When you have sparks, they take on an illusory or vicious aspect. Increase the results of your rolls using Heart or Hurt by $+1$, and when you perform Spark Stat Checks using either of these Stats it costs only $2$ Blessings instead.

Moreover, each character has a History Basic Stat, which is used to perform actions more related to the character's backstory more than to the other Basic Stats.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Three!"
    Begin to describe your character's backstory and list three specific skills that they have proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, or so on, as well as people and groups that they interacted with or had connections to. And if your game's setting has non-human characters and your character is one of them, also describe one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of your non-human species can perform unaided that human characters can't.

    These background details will help set the scope of what your History Stat Checks cover.

## Hero

Characters in this game have Heros that they look up to. The first time per session, when you succeed a Check or win a Contest by $5$ or more while acting as your Hero would, gain $3$ Blessings. Subsequent times gain $1$ Blessing instead.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Four!"
    Describe who your character looks up to, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?

## Abilities

Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, and Hero to make up their key defining traits.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Five!"
    Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. Have you seen characters like them before in movies, TV shows, and books? Were they the bully in school? Do they get drawn into conspiracy theories? Are they so laid-back that others think they're a slacker? Are they beautiful and popular? Are they quiet and hardworking? Etc. Try to envision the tropes from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

    With that in mind, pick two of the following Abilities to start the game with.

!!! compat "Session Shop: Abilities"
    At the end of a session, you may:

    - spend $2$ unspent Blessings to gain your third Ability
    - spend $5$ unspent Blessings to gain your fourth Ability
    - spend $10$ unspent Blessings to gain your fifth Ability by creating one of your own and gaining it, within reason

**Blessed by Luck:** Once per scene, when you fail a Check, you may spend $3$ Blessings to attempt the Check again, using the newer result instead.

**Blessed by Friendship:** Once per scene, you may spend a Blessing to help another character no matter the distance between you.

**Blessed by Action:** Once per scene, when you succeed a Check by $5$ or more, each character that witnessed the success gains a Blessing, including yourself.

**Blessed by Circumstance:** During a Contest involving three or more characters, you may spend $3$ Blessings to swap the results of two characters‚Äô rolls.

**Blessed by Self-Sacrifice:** During a Chase involving three or more characters, you may spend $1$ Blessing to reduce the result of your own roll to $0$.

**Blessed by Voices:** Once per scene, you may spend $2$ Blessings to learn more about a character, place, or fact than would normally be possible.

**Blessed by Family:** You may spend $2$ Blessings to attack recklessly, using Home for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. This attack is potentially lethal to your target if you win, and you may sustain injuries if you lose.

**Blessed by Self-Acceptance:** While you are Uncool, you may spend $1$ Blessing to roll a Check using a different Basic Stat than normal. Then if the Check succeeds, you are no longer Uncool.

**Blessed by Charity:** When you visit a place of religious or spiritual importance, you may spend any number of Blessings as a donation or act of service to the place. The more Blessings spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the DM.

**Blessed by Steadfastness:** When you succeed a Check or win a Contest by $5$ or more while acting as your Hero would, gain $2$ Blessings, instead of the usual amount.

**Mercurial Blessing:** When you succeed a Check or win a Contest by less than $5$ while acting directly contrary to how your Hero would, gain $1$ Blessing.

**Cursed Blessing:** Once per scene, when another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may spend $2$ Blessings to modify that character‚Äôs result by $-3$, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss.

**Medically Insured:** Once per scene, when a character fails a Check or loses a Contest to tend to your wounds, characters may spend a combined total of $3$ Blessings to turn the failure into a success or the loss into a win. Then, increase the number of Blessings needed to activate this ability by $2$.

**Focused Determination:** Each time you bump your dice, increase the result of the roll by an additional $+1$.

**Armored Skin:** Whenever you lose a violent Contest as the Defender, protect yourself for $+3$.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Protect Yourself for $+X$"
    When an effect describes a failed Check or lost Contest and says to ‚Äúprotect yourself for $+X$,‚Äù increase the result of your roll by $+X$. This cannot turn the failure into a success or loss into a win, but it can reduce the severity of the outcome.

**Careful Resolve:** Whenever you fail a Check while performing dangerous actions, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Tactful Speech:** Whenever you lose a Contest trying to persuade others, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Quickly Acclimated:** Whenever you fail a Check against natural effects such as weather and disease, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Steady Emotions:** Whenever you fail a Check or lose a Contest and would become Uncool as a result, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Synchronized Spark:** You may perform a Spark Stat Check using one of your Stats and one of the Stats of another willing character in the scene, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced and both characters have this ability.

**Ascendant Spark:** You may perform a non-violent Spark Stat Check using three Stats instead of two, so long as those Stats each use a $d8$ or larger. 

**Advanced Training:** Increase the result of your rolls using a $d8$ or larger by $+1$.

**Ease of Focus:** Your rolls using a $d8$ or larger also bump when you roll a $2$ on the die.

!!! details "DM Note: Replacing Abilities"
    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to lose or replace a Ability. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of Abilities is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    However, a suggestion is this: Whenever a player spends unspent Blessings to gain a new Ability, allow them the opportunity to also replace one of their existing Abilities.

## Items

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Six!"
    List three items that your character never leaves home without, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

When you need an item your character does not already have listed, it could still be narratively reasonable for your character to have that item on them anyway. Once per scene, to see if your character came prepared with just the item you need, within reason, spend a Blessing and perform a Home Stat Check. If you roll equal to or greater than twice the number of items you have listed, then the Check succeeds and you may add the item to your list. Otherwise, the Check fails and you may not perform another Home Stat Check this way this session.

## Playing the Game

### Bumping Dice

Dice in this game ‚Äúbump.‚Äù

When you roll a $1$ on a die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Succeeding on a Check or winning a Contest without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination and focus on the action.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group of Dice"
    In this game, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Stat Checks

To perform a Stat Check, roll the die for the action‚Äôs associated Stat. The DM will let you know which to use. Roll the die, and if the result meets or beats the DM‚Äôs target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Basic Stat Check Targets"
    Use $4$ for an easy Basic Stat Check, $8$ for medium, $12$ for hard, $16$ for very hard, and $20$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. The lowest possible Basic Stat Check is $2$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into, and each difficulty level above that is roughly equivalent to what the players could reach by spending one more Blessing. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $2$ or $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $12$ is the lowest difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.

### Balanced Stats can Spark

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

You may spend $3$ Blessings to perform a Spark Stat Check, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each. These Spark Stat Checks represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination -- and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark Stat Check also apply to the Spark Stat Check itself.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Spark Stat Check Targets"
    Use $8$ for an easy Spark Stat Check, $12$ for medium, $16$ for hard, $20$ for very hard, and $24$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. These difficulties are substantially higher than their mundane Basic Stat Check counterparts, representing both the greater capability yet greater risk of relying on their sparks. The lowest possible Spark Stat Check is $5$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into, and each difficulty level above that is roughly equivalent to what the players could reach by spending one more Blessing. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $2$ or $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $14$ is the lowest difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.

### Highs and Lows

When you succeed on a Check or win a Contest by $5$ or more above the number you needed to reach, then something extra cool may happen. On the other hand, when you fail a Check or lose a Contest by $5$ or more, then something extra bad may happen. Failing or losing by $10$ or more can be disastrous.

### Surprise Threat

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump and cannot be a Spark Stat Check.

### Blessings

Several times during a session, the DM may award you a Blessing, represented by a small token.

Once per roll, whether your own or another character‚Äôs, you may spend a Blessing to increase the result of that roll by $+1d4$. You may only spend Blessings to help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably help with the action.

!!! warning "Rules Notes: Helping as a Team"
    While a single character can give only one Blessing per roll to help another character, multiple characters can come together to give multiple Blessings together to that character.

!!! details "DM Note: When to Award Blessings"
    Mechanically, players may earn Blessings by acting as their Hero would. However, you as a DM should award them Blessings consistently and throughout each session, as many characters‚Äô abilities depend on them.

    However, what this looks like can vary per DM, per table, or per scene.

    Some DMs may prefer a ‚Äúfail forward‚Äù approach like in *Kids on Bikes*, where Blessings are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer a "natural" approach like in *Dungeons and Dragons*, where they award them when the players roll some lucky number before modifiers, like $8$ or the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessings suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

    The way you award Blessings is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a DM in this game! Use it well!

### Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may be asked to attempt a Check to remove this condition.

!!! details "DM Note: Becoming Uncool"
    The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

    How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

    Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

    So when you build the narrative of around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character‚Äôs will using any Stat besides Hurt. To perform a non-violent Contest, first the Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Stat Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. The action‚Äôs effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The severity of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores. If the Attacker uses a Spark Stat Check, then the Defender may roll a Spark Stat Check using the same Stats, or a Stat Check using either of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark Stat Check.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Non-violent Effects"
    A difference less than $5$ on a nonviolent Contest represents a minor effect or the Attacker getting what they wanted, within reason, and with complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains is temporary.
    
    A difference of at least $5$ but less than $10$ represents a medium effect or a lack of complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains lasts for several rolls by or against the Defender.
    
    And a difference of $10$ or more represents a major effect than can change the narrative arc of the session or even campaign.

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character‚Äôs will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest, the Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurt, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene. If the Attacker rolls higher, then the Defender could be bruised, dazed, concussed, in need of immediate medical attention, or even dead. The amount that the Attacker rolled higher than the Defender determines the extent of the injury‚Äîregardless if that was what the Attacker intended. If the Defender rolls the same or higher number than the Attacker, then no injury occurs.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Violent Effects"
    As with nonviolent Contests, a difference less than $5$ represents a minor wound that grants the Attacker only a temporary advantage.
    
    A difference at least $5$ but less than $10$ represents a wound that will need medical attention, possibly changing the narrative arc of the session to treat it, granting lasting effects if not treated successfully and in a timely manner.
    
    And a difference of $10$ or more on a violent Contest represents immediate death or grave injuries to the Defender needing immediate attention or a miracle.

If both characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attack, then they each roll as Defenders, narrating how they respond. Injuries are then determined as usual.

If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these attacks with a greater range of options, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

!!! warning "Rules Note: Checks vs. Contests"
    Checks use the terms ‚Äúfail‚Äù and ‚Äúsucceed,‚Äù while Contests use ‚Äúlose‚Äù and ‚Äúwin‚Äù instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another. For example, Blessed by Luck allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Eager Lifestyle on the other hand does grant a bonus to Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Chases

Chases are extended Contests during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, or for the Defenders to reach their destination before being caught by the Attackers.

Chases are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters perform Contests against one another to progress themselves and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved perform Stat Checks to overcome hazards in the environment.

To perform a Chase:

1. Place a token representing each character involved in the Chase on a number line, starting at position $0$. Then, the DM describes the winning and losing conditions of the Chase, such as being the first to reach at least space $20$ at the end of a round or to have moved the furthest at the end of $3$ rounds.
2. At the top of each round, the characters perform a Contest representing their movement, using Hand, Hurry, Hurt (if pursuing others violently), or another Stat as appropriate.
3. The character who rolled the highest moves forward on the number line. The amount they rolled higher than the lowest roll of the Contest determines the number of spaces moved, either $2$, $3$, or $5$ spaces.
4. Starting with the characters who rolled the lowest at the start of the round, characters may perform a Contest against their opponents involved in the Chase. For each Contest, everyone except the losing side of the Contest moves forward, and the amount the winning side won by determines the number of spaces moved, either $1$, $2$, or $3$ spaces. A character can only be involved in a single Contest this way, regardless if they are involved as an Attacker or Defender.
5. At the end of the round, the DM may describe an environmental hazard that could affect all or some of the leading characters involved the Chase, asking them to perform a Check to avoid the effects.
6. Repeat rounds until the Chase has been won.

### Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Instead, wounds shape the narrative arcs of the game. Additionally, Attackers may gain a bonus to their rolls when they target a wounded character; the worse the wound, the bigger the bonus.

### Contest Positions

Positions during violent Contests are tracked narratively. There are four ranges: touching, nearby, ranged, and distant. When an Attacker attacks with a weapon they are trained in that is appropriate for their current range to their target, the attacker receives a $+2$ bonus to their roll.

### Group Contests

If multiple characters are Attackers together in a Contest, then they each perform their respective rolls and the median of their results is used to determine the group‚Äôs shared result.

If multiple characters are Defenders together in a Contest, or are performing a coordinated Check, then they each perform their respective rolls, and if at least half would succeed the Check or win the Contest, then the group as a whole succeeds or wins.
