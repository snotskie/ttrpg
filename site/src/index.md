## About

*Humanity, Blessed* is a rules-light TTRPG system inspired by our favorite games, designed to tell stories, about what it means to be human, doing goofy, cool, fantastic little human things.

## Basic Stats

Each character in this game has seven Basic Stats, represented by the "seven H‚Äôs" described below. Together, these Basic Stats describe a character's general capabilities at wide ranges of tasks and situations.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step One!"
    Your first task is to decide which Stats your character is best (and worst) at! Rank your "seven H's" from the one your character is most capable at to least capable at. As you do, begin to think about the story your character takes on in your mind. Why are they good at this and not at that? Why is one important to them and not the other?

**üß† Head:** Intellectual pursuits, problem solving, puzzles, riddles, scanning for information, recalling facts, insight, reasoning, operating and building complex machines, playing practiced music

**‚úåÔ∏è Hand:** Athletic pursuits, sleight of hand, activities that require physical training, raw non-violent strength, moving quietly

**üíï Heart:** Speaking with passion, understanding others, reading emotions, playing music improvisationally

**ü©π Home:** Protecting yourself and loved ones, taking hits, tending to wounds, haggling, survival skills, cooking, navigating towns and dwellings, remaining calm, staying alert, coming prepared

**üëø Hurt:** Nerve and willingness to inflict harm on others

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry:** Escaping danger, reacting by instinct, surges of adrenaline

**‚è≥ History:** Other aspects covered by your character's backstory and the history of their people not covered by the Basic Stats above

When you begin the game, all of your Basic Stats are equal, each using a $d4$ for their Basic Stat Checks. These can be upgraded in the [Session Shop](#Session-Shop).

## Lifestyle and History

Each character in this game has one of three Lifestyles, described below. A character's Lifestyle represents their general background and goals, and can change over the course of the story.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Two!"
    Begin to describe the Lifestyle your character had growing up or their current outlook on life. As you do, pick one of the following Lifestyles to start the game with.

**üçÄ Carefree:** Your character lives a relatively carefree life, perhaps because of your young age, wealthy upbringing, or optimistic demeanor. Upgrading your Heart and Hurry dice cost ‚ë† less each time.

**üî• Eager:** Your character is eager for more out of life, perhaps because of a teenage rebellious phase, a yearning to accomplish your dreams, or a person you want to impress. Upgrading your Hand and Hurt dice cost ‚ë† less each time.

**üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wisened:** Life has not been easy on your character, but as a result you‚Äôve come out wiser and tougher, perhaps because you‚Äôve gotten older, been shaped by unfortunate events, or dedicated yourself to your work. Upgrading your Hand and Home dice cost ‚ë† less each time.

Moreover, each character has a History Basic Stat, which is used to perform actions more related to the character's backstory more than to the other Basic Stats.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Three!"
    Begin to describe your character's backstory. Answer the following prompts, or others given to you by your DM. These background details will help build the story and set the scope of what your History Stat Checks cover when other Basic Stats don't apply.
    
    - Describe who your character looks up to, whose work they strive to emulate, who taught them everything they know, or so on. What would it look like to make their Hero happy? upset? What is their connection to their Hero, and what is their Hero up to in the world now?
    - List three specific skills that your character has proven their ability in, such as through schooling, study, training, specialization within their team, or so on.
    - List three specific people or groups that your character regularly interacts with or have connections to
    - Describe where your character could be found on an average Tuesday afternoon before the action of the story gets underway.
    - If your game's setting has non-human characters and your character is one of them, also describe one or two simple actions, within reason, that characters of your non-human species can perform unaided that human characters can't.

## Abilities

Characters in this game have a set of Abilities that grant them certain actions or bonuses over the course of the game. These Abilities work together with characters' Stats, Lifestyle, and Backstory to make up their key defining traits.

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Four!"
    Begin to imagine the kind of character taking shape in your mind. Have you seen characters like them before in movies, TV shows, and books? Were they the bully in school? Do they get drawn into conspiracy theories? Are they so laid-back that others think they're a slacker? Are they beautiful and popular? Are they quiet and hardworking? Etc. Try to envision the tropes from your favorite fictional stories that your character takes after.

    With that in mind, pick two of the following Abilities to start the game with.

**Focused Determination:** Each time you bump your dice, increase the result of the roll by an additional $+1$.

**Efficiently Packed:** When you perform a Home Stat Check to see if you came prepared with an item, roll as though your Home Stat used one die size larger, to a maximum of a $d10$.

**Past Repeated:** Up to once per session, when you fail a non-violent Check or lose a non-violent Contest, you may choose to channel a past memory to guide you. If you do, for the rest of the scene, you may use your History Stat in place of the Stat you failed the Check or lost the Contest with.

**Armored Skin:** Whenever you lose a violent Contest as the Defender, protect yourself for $+3$.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Protect Yourself for $+X$"
    When an effect describes a failed Check or lost Contest and says to ‚Äúprotect yourself for $+X$,‚Äù increase the result of your roll by $+X$. This cannot turn the failure into a success or loss into a win, but it can reduce the severity of the outcome.

**Careful Resolve:** Whenever you fail a Check while performing dangerous actions, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Tactful Speech:** Whenever you lose a Contest trying to persuade others, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Quickly Acclimated:** Whenever you fail a Check against natural effects such as weather and disease, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Steady Emotions:** Whenever you fail a Check or lose a Contest and would become Uncool as a result, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Licensed Driver:** Whenever you fail a Check or lose a Contest while transporting others, protect yourself for $+3$.

**Optimal Solution:** Up to twice per session, when you or a nearby ally attempt a roll for a non-violent Check or Contest, you may roll $4d6$; these dice do not bump. Group those dice into two piles of two dice such that a simple operation (addition or multiplication) could be performed to each pile so that the two operations' results would be equal. For example, if you rolled $1$, $1$, $1$, and $2$, you could group the piles such that $1√ó2=1+1$. If you are able to arrange the $4d6$ in such a way, you or your ally increases the result of their attempted roll by $+5$.

**Synchronized Spark:** You may perform a Spark Stat Check using one of your Stats and one of the Stats of another willing character in the scene, so long as the chosen Stats are balanced, both characters have this ability, and one of the two characters pays the Blessing Die cost.

**Ascendant Spark:** You may perform a non-violent Spark Stat Check using three Stats instead of two, so long as those Stats each use a $d8$ or larger.

**Advanced Training:** Increase the result of your rolls using a $d8$ or larger by $+1$.

**Ease of Focus:** Your rolls using a $d8$ or larger also bump when you roll a $2$ on the die.

**Radical Self-Acceptance:** While you are Uncool, you may roll Checks using a different Basic Stat than normal. Then once a Check succeeds this way, you are no longer Uncool.

**Blessed by Luck:** When you fail a Check, you may attempt the Check again, using the newer result instead. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

!!! note "Effect Wording: Spend ‚ìç to Recharge"
    Some abilities, once activated, cannot be activated again until they have been "recharged" by spending ‚ìç from your pool of Blessing Dice.

**Blessed by Circumstance:** During a Contest involving three or more characters, you may swap the results of two characters‚Äô rolls. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Self-Sacrifice:** During a Chase involving three or more characters, you may reduce the result of your own roll to $0$. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë° to recharge it.

**Blessed by Voices:** You may learn more about a character, place, or fact than would normally be possible, and this knowledge may come with consequences. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Family:** You may attack recklessly, using Home or History for a violent Contest instead of Hurt as usual. This attack is potentially lethal to your target if you win, and you may sustain injuries if you lose. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë£ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Charity:** When you visit a place of religious or spiritual importance, you may spend any number of ‚ë† as a donation or act of service to the place. The more spent this way, the greater a possible later boon may be, determined by the DM.

!!! details "DM Note: Blessed by Charity's Boon"
    How you rule the boon given by the "Blessed by Charity" ability may vary by session, setting, scene, or even be determined in the moment when the players need it most.

    However, some ideas are:

    - Create a tiered scale ahead of time, where the player unlocks different tiers of a boon as more Blessing Dice are donated. This is the simplest option, but requires prior planning creating the tiered scale.
    - Grant the player a $+2$ bonus to a roll in their time of need for each Blessing Dice donated. This is the simplest option presented here, and depending on the situation may feel satisfying or underwhelming.
    - Grant the player a $+X$ bonus to a roll in their time of need, where $X$ is the number of Blessing Dice donated. Then, have them roll $Xd6$; if they roll a $1$ on any of those dice, they gain the $+X$ bonus again and repeat this step. This option likely guarantees success on a vital roll, requires no prior planning, and can feel satisfyingly chaotic.

**Blessed by Thorns:** When you lose a violent Contest at a close distance, you may have your Attackers receive a less severe version of the same injury you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Wits:** When you lose a non-violent Contest against a single Attacker, you may have the Attacker receive a less severe version of the same effect you received from losing the Contest. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë¢ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Steadfastness:** When you fail a Check or lose a Contest by $5$ or more, gain a Blessing.

**Blessed by Disruption:** When another character succeeds a Check or wins a Contest, you may modify that character‚Äôs result by $-3$, possibly turning their success into a failure or win into a loss. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë§ to recharge it.

**Blessed by Insurance:** When a character fails a Check or loses a Contest to tend to your wounds, that character may turn the failure into a success or the loss into a win. Then this ability cannot be activated again until you spend ‚ë†‚ë†‚ë† to recharge it, and when it is recharged, increase the cost to recharge it by ‚ë†‚ë†.

!!! details "DM Note: Replacing Abilities"
    Mechanically, there is no way for a character to lose or replace a Ability. However, you and your player may feel it is narratively appropriate to reflect their character's growth in response to powerful story events. How you rule the change of Abilities is up to you, as the best approach can vary from story to story.
    
    One suggestion is this: Whenever a player gains a new Ability, allow them the opportunity to also replace one of their existing Abilities.

## Items

!!! tip "Character Creation: Step Five!"
    List three items that your character never leaves home without, within reason. These will be the items you start the game with.

## Playing the Game

### Bumping Dice

Dice in this game ‚Äúbump.‚Äù

When you roll a $1$ on a die, roll it again, adding the new result to its previous result. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to roll again and add this way.

Additionally, some effects will ask you to roll a group of dice, denoted such as $2d6$. When rolling a group of dice, if you roll a $1$ on either die, then you roll all dice in the group again and add to the previous result. And as long as you continue to roll a $1$ on either die, you continue to roll the group again and add this way.

Succeeding on a Check or winning a Contest without bumping represents natural or trained ability, while doing so with bumping represents a character's extra determination and focus on the action.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Group of Dice"
    In this game, $2d6$ is different from $1d6+1d6$. Only when an effect explicitly groups dice together are they considered a group for bumping. For example, both dice of the $2d6$ group are rerolled when either rolls a $1$. However, the dice of the $1d6+1d6$ are considered separate groups, so rolling a $1$ on one of the dice only affects that one die.

### Stat Checks

To perform a Stat Check, roll the die for the action‚Äôs associated Stat. The DM will let you know which to use. Roll the die, and if the result meets or beats the DM‚Äôs target number, then the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Basic Stat Check Targets"
    Use $4$ for an easy Basic Stat Check, $8$ for medium, $12$ for hard, $16$ for very hard, and $20$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. The lowest possible Basic Stat Check is $2$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $2$ or $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $12$ is the lowest Basic Stat Check difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.

### Balanced Stats can Spark

When two of a character's Stats use the same die, those Stats are "balanced."

You may spend ‚ë£ to perform a Spark Stat Check instead of a Basic Stat Check, which combines the dice of two balanced Stats into a single group, such as $2d6$ formed from two balanced Stats using a $d6$ each. These Spark Stat Checks represent a character's momentary "spark," that hint of magic or ability to achieve amazing feats, that penchant for pulling out surprising wins, and so on. These "sparks" are what allow characters to perform far beyond what is normally possible by the laws of nature, limited only by their imagination -- and ability to control powerful and strange forces!

Any bonuses or effects that would apply to the balanced Stats used in the Spark Stat Check also apply to the Spark Stat Check itself.

!!! details "DM Note: Setting Spark Stat Check Targets"
    Use $8$ for an easy Spark Stat Check, $12$ for medium, $16$ for hard, $20$ for very hard, and $24$ for a trial the players will be greatly awarded for overcoming. These difficulties are substantially higher than their mundane Basic Stat Check counterparts, representing both the greater capability yet greater risk of relying on their sparks. The lowest possible Spark Stat Check is $4$.
    
    Medium is the average for rolls in most situations the players will get themselves into. For situations that you surprise your players with that they don't have the chance to prepare for before reacting, consider lowering the difficulty by $2$ or $3$. The reason is that surprise situations are more likely to use characters' lower Stat Dice.
    
    Also keep in mind that $14$ is the lowest Spark Stat Check difficulty where a player can fail bad enough for disastrous results.

### Highs and Lows

When you succeed on a Check or win a Contest by $5$ or more above the number you needed to reach, then something extra cool may happen. On the other hand, when you fail a Check or lose a Contest by $5$ or more, then something extra bad may happen. Failing or losing by $10$ or more can be disastrous.

### Surprise Threat

When a character is surprised by a threat, their first roll in response to it cannot bump and cannot be a Spark Stat Check.

### Blessing Dice

Characters in this game each have a pool of Blessing Dice, representing a pool of resources they can draw upon to recharge their abilities and help their friends.

The first time each session when you succeed a Check or win a Contest by $5$ or more, gain $3$ Blessing Dice. The DM may also award you Blessing Dice for other achievements.

When you gain a Blessing Die, roll a $d6$ then add that die to your pool of Blessing Dice. If you roll a $1$ on the die, gain an additional Blessing Die. As long as you continue to roll a $1$ on the die, you continue to gain an additional Blessing Die.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Blessing Dice do not Group"
    If you gain multiple Blessing Dice from a single effect, gain each of those dice separately. They do not form a group for the purposes of bumping.

!!! details "DM Note: When to Award Blessing Dice"
    Mechanically, players may earn Blessing Dice by rolling high once per session. However, you as a DM should award them Blessing Dice consistently and throughout each session, as many characters‚Äô abilities depend on them.

    What this looks like can vary per DM, per table, or per scene.

    Some DMs may prefer a ‚Äúfail forward‚Äù approach like in *Kids on Bikes*, where Blessing Dice are given whenever a player fails a check. Others may prefer a "natural" approach like in *Dungeons and Dragons*, where they award them when the players roll the highest value on their die. Others still may prefer to award them when the players engage in cool roleplay, when they solve puzzles or complete quests, as a fixed supply at the start of each session or arc, or so on. And having the source of Blessing Dice suddenly dry up in grittier parts of the story can be a *very* effective way to put the pressure on.

    The way you award Blessing Dice is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt as a DM in this game! Use it well!

    All this being said, we recommend new DMs to this game use the following:

    - Award $2$ Blessing Dice near the start of the first session, such asc after the player has introduced their character
    - Award $3$ Blessing Dice the first time the player succeeds a Check or wins a Contest by $5$ or more
    - Award a Blessing Die for good role play and creative solutions
    - Award a Blessing Die each time the player rolls the "lucky number" for the session. To determine the lucky number, at the start of each session, roll two $d10$ and use the higher value as the lucky number for the session. If a $1$ is rolled on both die this way, then there is no lucky number for the session, as it is impossible to score lower than a $2$ on rolls in this game
    - Award a number of Blessing Dice at the end of sessions where players completed important milestones in the story

Some actions can only be performed by first "spending" some number of dice from your pool of Blessing Dice each worth some value or more.

The notation ‚ë† represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $1$ or more. The notation ‚ë° represents a single die from your pool of Blessing Dice worth $2$ or more. And so on.

The notation ‚ë†‚ë† represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice, each worth $1$ or more. The notation ‚ë°‚ë° represents two dice from your pool of Blessing Dice, each worth $2$ or more. And so on.

When a Blessing Die is spent, it is removed from your pool of Blessing Dice.

### Helping

Once per roll, whether your own or another character‚Äôs, you may spend any number of ‚ë† to increase the result of that roll by $+1$ for each ‚ë† spent. You may only spend ‚ë† to help other characters this way if your character is near enough to them to reasonably help with the action.

### Coming Prepared

When you need an item your character does not already have listed, it could still be narratively reasonable for your character to have that item on them anyway. Once per scene, to see if your character came prepared with just the item you need, within reason, spend ‚ë† and perform a Home Stat Check. If you roll equal to or greater than twice the number of items you have listed, then the Check succeeds and you may add the item to your list. Otherwise, the Check fails and you may not perform another Home Stat Check this way this session.

### Coolness

Some events challenge your resolve, throw you off your game, cause you great embarrassment, or so on. When these happen, you may become Uncool.

While you are Uncool, all rolls you make are modified by $-1$. Once during each scene that follows, you may be asked to attempt a Check to remove this condition.

!!! details "DM Note: Becoming Uncool"
    The Uncool mechanic is a way to break the tension and bring comedy to your game. It is also a way to represent small story arcs where characters feel bad after some failed action, and take action later to feel better about it. And it is a way to connect player characters more to the non-player characters watching them.

    How and when you dole out this condition depends on what is best for your table, players, and story. A suggestion is to help the player tell the story of how their character is feeling after a particularly bad roll (failing or losing by $5$ or more). Who else is around that saw it happen? How would their Hero feel? How does this relate to what they've established about their backstory, goal, Lifestyle, or connection to other characters?

    Equally important is how you give the players opportunities to *remove* this condition. Each attempt should be a fun, satisfying story beat that helps shape the narrative of how the player's character grows.

    So when you build the narrative of around how a character becomes Uncool and what this means for their connections to other characters, keep in the back of your head how you could use these same connections later to remove the condition and offer the player a chance to roleplay growth from their earlier failure.

### Contests

A non-violent Contest is when a character performs an action against another character‚Äôs will using any Stat besides Hurt. To perform a non-violent Contest, first the Attacker rolls as though performing the appropriate Stat Check, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Stat Check using the same Stat as the Attacker. The action‚Äôs effect is only successful if the Attacker rolls higher than the Defender. The severity of the effect is determined by the difference between their scores. If the Attacker uses a Spark Stat Check, then the Defender may roll a Spark Stat Check using the same Stats, or a Stat Check using either of the Stats used in the Attacker's Spark Stat Check.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Non-violent Effects"
    - Minor Effect: A difference less than $5$ on a nonviolent Contest represents a minor effect or the Attacker getting what they wanted, within reason, and with complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains is temporary.
    - Medium Effect: A difference of at least $5$ but less than $10$ represents a medium effect or a lack of complications. Any advantage the Attacker gains lasts for several rolls by or against the Defender.
    - Major Effect: A difference of $10$ or more represents a major effect than can change the narrative arc of the session or even campaign.

A violent Contest is when an Attacker performs an action against another character‚Äôs will using their Hurt Stat. All Contests involving Hurt are potentially deadly. Unexpected things can happen and things can get out of hand quickly.

To perform a violent Contest, the Attacker first rolls as though performing a Hurt Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurt, then the Defender rolls as though performing a Hurry Stat Check or Spark Stat Check that involves Hurry, representing their immediate instinctive reaction in the scene. If the Attacker rolls higher, then the Defender could be bruised, dazed, concussed, in need of immediate medical attention, or even dead. The amount that the Attacker rolled higher than the Defender determines the extent of the injury‚Äîregardless if that was what the Attacker intended. If the Defender rolls the same or higher number than the Attacker, then no injury occurs.

!!! details "DM Note: Severity of Violent Effects"
    - Minor Effect: As with nonviolent Contests, a difference less than $5$ represents a minor wound that grants the Attacker only a temporary advantage.
    - Medium Effect: A difference at least $5$ but less than $10$ represents a wound that will need medical attention, possibly changing the narrative arc of the session to treat it, granting lasting effects if not treated successfully and in a timely manner.
    - Major Effect: A difference of $10$ or more on a violent Contest represents immediate death or grave injuries to the Defender needing immediate attention or a miracle.

If the violence continues past this initial Contest, then the Attackers may choose to change tactics, such as performing a non-violent Contest to shift subsequent rounds in their favor. Additionally, Defenders may choose to respond to these attacks with a greater range of options, such as outwitting (Head), calling on honor (Hand), destroying a part of the environment (Hand), calling for a truce (Heart), or repositioning oneself (Head or Home).

And for both violent and non-violent Contests, if both characters are attacking one another at the same time, then each character first rolls as Attackers, narrating how they attack, then they each roll as Defenders, narrating how they respond. Effects are then determined as usual.

!!! warning "Rules Note: Checks vs. Contests"
    Checks use the terms ‚Äúfail‚Äù and ‚Äúsucceed,‚Äù while Contests use ‚Äúlose‚Äù and ‚Äúwin‚Äù instead. When an effect only mentions failing or succeeding Checks, it does not affect losing or winning Contests. And when an effect only mentions losing or winning Contests, it does not affect failing or succeeding Checks. A Contest itself is not a Check, though it does involve a series of rolls similar to Checks made against one another. For example, Blessed by Luck allows you to turn a failed Check into a success. However, it does not allow you to turn a lost Contest into a win. The Uncool condition on the other hand does affect both Checks and Contests, because it modifies the results of rolls performed, without mentioning success, failure, win, or loss directly.

### Group Contests

If multiple characters are Attackers together in a Contest, then they each perform their respective rolls and the median of their results is used to determine the group‚Äôs shared result.

If multiple characters are Defenders together in a Contest, or are performing a coordinated Check, then they each perform their respective rolls, and if at least half would succeed the Check or win the Contest, then the group as a whole succeeds or wins.

### Wounds

You do not have "hit points" in this game. Instead, wounds shape the narrative arcs of the game; the worse the wound, the greater and longer lasting the impact.

### Chases

Chases are extended Contests during which the characters involved race to be the first to reach some destination, to be the first to acheive some action, to escape without being caught, to advance an objective before time runs out, or so on. Many scenes where the tension is drawn out can be run as "chases."

Chases are carried out as a number of rounds in which the characters perform Contests against one another to progress themselves and slow their opponents. Additionally, characters involved perform Stat Checks to overcome hazards in the environment.

To perform a Chase:

1. **Setup:** Place a token representing each character involved in the Chase on a number line, starting at position $0$. Then, the DM describes the winning and losing conditions of the Chase, such as being the first to reach at least space $20$ at the end of a round, to have moved the furthest at the end of $3$ rounds, to be the last one standing by avoiding environmental hazards, or so on or some combination of conditions.
2. **Gaining the Advantage:** At the top of each round, the characters perform a Contest representing their movement, using the most appropriate Stat for the situation: Hand, Hurry, Hurt (if pursuing others violently), or another Stat. Then, only the character(s) who rolled the highest move(s) forward on the number line. The severity of the amount they rolled higher than the lowest roll of the Contest determines the number of spaces moved, moving $2$ spaces for a Minor Effect, $3$ for a Medium Effect, or $5$ for a Major Effect.
3. **Responding:** Starting with the character(s) who rolled the lowest at the start of the round, characters may work together to perform Contests against their opponents involved in the Chase. For each Contest, the winning side of the Contest moves forward, and the severity of the amount the winning side won by determines the number of spaces moved, moving $1$ space for a Minor Effect, $2$ for a Medium Effect, or $3$ for a Major Effect. A character can only be involved in a single Contest this way, regardless if they are involved as an Attacker or Defender.
4. **Hazards:** At the end of the round, the DM may describe an environmental hazard that could affect all or some of the leading characters involved the Chase, asking them to perform a Check to avoid the effects.
5. **Ending:** Repeat rounds until the Chase has been won.

### Conditions

While most effects help shape the narrative of the game, your DM may find it appropriate to apply conditions to characters when the situation calls for it. Some example conditions are given below:

- **Headache/Handcramp/Heartache/Homesick:** Rolls you make with the affected Stat are made with a $-1$ modifier. This condition lasts until the end of the scene.
- **Weakened:** Rolls you make as a Defender in violent Contests are made with a $-2$ modifier. Resting or tending to your wounds ends this condition.
- **Agreeable to $X$:** Rolls you make as a Defender in non-violent Contests where $X$ is an Attacker are made with a $-2$ modifier. If $X$ does an action or makes a request that would bring you harm, this condition ends.
- **Slowed/Mislead:** The next roll you make to gain the advantage in a Chase is made with a $-2$ modifier. Then, this condition ends.
- **Exhausted/Cursed:** Dice in your pool of Blessing Dice are each worth $1$ less, to a minimum of $1$. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Distracted:** Rolls you make do not bump. This condition ends when you remove its cause.
- **Disarmed:** If you would win a violent Contest as the Attacker by $10$ or more, you win by $9$ instead. When you find a new weapon or take a moment to recompose yourself, this condition ends.
- **Taxed:** You cannot perform Spark Stat Checks. Spending ‚ë†‚ë† ends this condition.
